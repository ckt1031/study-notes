## Question 34

A capacitor is charging in a simple RC circuit with a DC battery. Which one of the following statements about this capacitor is accurate?

1. There is a magnetic field between the capacitor plates because charge travels between the plates by jumping from one plate to the other.
2. **There is a magnetic field between the capacitor plates, even though no charge travels between them, because the electric flux between the plates is changing.**
3. The magnetic field between the capacitor plates is increasing with time because the charge on the plates is increasing.
4. There is a magnetic field between the capacitor plates, even though no charge travels between them, because the magnetic flux between the plates is changing.
5. There is no magnetic field between the capacitor plates because no charge travels between the plates.
