## Four Fundamental Forces

| Name            | Relative strength | Range (meter) | Description                                                     |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Strong          | $10^{38}$         | $10^{-15}$    | Binding quarks into hadrons, and neutrons and protons in nuclei |
| Electromagnetic | $10^{36}$         | $\infty$      |                                                                 |
| Weak            | $10^{25}$         | $10^{-18}$    | Transforming neutron into proton in nuclear decay               |
| Gravitation     | $1$               | $\infty$      |                                                                 |

## Origin of charge

> Charge cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred.

- **Fundamental Charges:** The charges of the electron and proton are equal in magnitude.  
- **Conservation of Charge:** In any ==closed system==, the algebraic sum of all electric charges is constant.

| Name     | Charge                               | Mass                                 |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Proton   | $+1.602\times 10^{-19} \ \mathrm{C}$ | $1.673\times 10^{-27} \ \mathrm{kg}$ |
| Neutron  | 0                                    | $1.675\times 10^{-27} \ \mathrm{kg}$ |
| Electron | $-1.602\times 10^{-19} \ \mathrm{C}$ | $9.109\times 10^{-31} \ \mathrm{kg}$ |

## Conductors, Insulators

- **Conductors and Insulators:** A conductor allows charge to move easily through it, whereas an insulator does not.

## Charging Mechanisms

- **Like Charges Repel:** When two plastic rods are rubbed with fur, they acquire the same type of charge and repel each other. Similarly, two glass rods rubbed with ==silk repel==.
- **Opposite Charges Attract:** A plastic rod rubbed with fur and a glass rod rubbed with silk acquire opposite charges and attract each other. The fur and silk also attract the rods they rubbed.

### Grounding

> Connecting an electrical conductor to the Earth. The Earth acts as a vast, ==virtually infinite reservoir of charge (both positive and negative)== due to its immense size and conductive nature.

Grounding **neutralizes charged objects** by either flowing electrons from object to Earth or from Earth to object.

### Why Electrons Move Rather Than Positive Charges in Grounding

1. **Electrons are in the Outer Shells**
2. **Protons are in the Nucleus**
3. High **Electron Mobility**

## Coulomb's Law

Magnitude of the electric force: (Do not use absolute value if finding force vector)

$$F = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2}$$

- $r$ is the distance between the centers of the two charges.  
- $\epsilon_0$ is the **vacuum permittivity** (a constant). $\epsilon_0 = 8.854 \times 10^{-12} \ \mathrm{C^2/(N \cdot m^2)}$
- Charges of the same sign **repel**.
- Charges of opposite signs **attract**.

### Comparison to Gravitation

Electric force is **much stronger**.

Example: For two helium nuclei ($\ce{He^{2+}}$), the ratio of electric to gravitational force is $F_e/F_g = 3.1 \times 10^{35}$

## Electric Field Due to a Point Charge

$$\vec{E} = \frac{\vec{F}_0}{q_0} \quad = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q}{r^2} \hat{r}$$

- For a **positive** source charge $q$, the electric field points radially **outward**.
- For a **negative** source charge $q$, the electric field points radially **inward**.  
- **Superposition Principle for Electric Fields**: The total electric field at a point due to a system of point charges is the vector sum of the electric fields produced by each individual charge. $$\vec{E}_{total} = \vec{E}_1 + \vec{E}_2 + \vec{E}_3 + \dots$$

### The Motion of Charges in Electric Field

The charge will not immediately follow the electric field direction because of inertia, as its mass resists instantaneous changes in velocity. The electric field causes acceleration, gradually altering the particle's existing momentum and trajectory over time.
