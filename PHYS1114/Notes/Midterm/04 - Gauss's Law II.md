## Uniformly Charged Sphere

> Consider a non-conducting sphere of radius R with a total charge Q distributed uniformly throughout its volume.

By symmetry, the electric field $E$ must be purely radial, and its magnitude can only depend on ==the distance $r$ from the center==.

### Case 1: Outside the Sphere ($r>R$)

Outside a uniformly charged sphere, **the electric field is identical** to that of a point charge Q located at the center.

$$
\begin{align}
E \cdot (4 \pi r ^2)  & = \frac{Q}{\epsilon_{0}} \\
E  & = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0}} \frac{Q}{r^2}
\end{align}
$$

### Case 2: Inside the Sphere ($r<R$)

$$
\begin{align}
\rho  & = \frac{Q}{V_{\text{Total}}} = \frac{Q}{\frac{4}{3} \pi R^3} \\
Q_{\text{Encl}}  & = \rho \cdot V_{\text{Guassian}}  = \frac{Q}{\frac{4}{3} \pi R^3} \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \\
 & = Q \frac{r^3}{R^3}
\end{align}
$$

$$
\begin{align}
E \cdot (4 \pi r^2)  & = \frac{1}{\epsilon_{0}} Q \frac{r^3}{R^3} \\
E & = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0}} \frac{Q}{R^3} r \\
 & = \frac{\rho r}{3 \epsilon_{0}} (\text{Uniformly Charged Sphere})
\end{align}
$$

## Long Uniform Line Charge

By symmetry, the electric field must point radially outward from the line, and its magnitude can only depend on the **perpendicular distance $r$ from the line**.

Gaussian surface is a coaxial cylinder of radius $r$ and length $L$.

On the end caps, $E$ is perpendicular to $dA$, so the flux through the end caps is $\mathbf{zero}$.

$$
\begin{align}
Q_{\text{encl}}  & = \lambda \cdot L \\
\Phi_{E}  & = E \cdot (2 \pi r L) = \frac{\lambda L}{\epsilon_{0}} \\
E & = \frac{1}{2 \pi \epsilon_{0}} \frac{\lambda}{r} \\
 & = \frac{\rho r}{3 \epsilon_{0}} (\text{Very long insulating cylinder})
\end{align}
$$

Decays at $\frac{1}{r}$, slower than $\frac{1}{r^2}$ by a point charge.

## Infinite Sheet of Charge

By symmetry, the electric field must be **uniform and directed perpendicular** to the sheet, pointing away from it on both sides.

**Gaussian surface is a small cylinder or "pillbox" of cross-sectional area A** that pierces the sheet, with its flat end caps parallel to the sheet.

$$
\begin{align}
\Phi_{E} & = EA _{\text{Cap 1}} + EA _{\text{Cap 2}} \\
2EA & = \frac{\sigma A}{\epsilon_{0}} \\
E & = \frac{\sigma}{2 \epsilon_{0}}  \\
 & = \frac{\rho d}{2 \epsilon_{0}}
\end{align}
$$

## Field at the Surface of a Conductor of Arbitrary Shape

![[04-conductor-surface-efield.excalidraw]]

Since inside conductor has no e-field, only the cap outside conductor has flux.

$$
E_{\perp} A + 0 = \frac{Q}{\epsilon_{0}}
$$

This formula is true only when surface where $\vec{\mathbf{E}}$ is perpendicular to surface.

## Applications of Guass's Law

### Electrostatic Shielding and the Faraday Cage

![image](https://obsidian-img-studies.tsun1031.xyz/2025/06/24/657964b3c25c3e96379e6fff5c2e6e1a.png)

A **Faraday cage** is a closed conducting enclosure that is used to shield its interior from external static electric fields.

When an external electric field is applied to the cage, **the mobile charges within the conductor redistribute themselves on the outer surface**.

This redistribution ==creates an induced electric field inside the conductor that exactly cancels the external field==, resulting in a net electric field of zero throughout the interior of the cage.

The shielding is directional, it *shields its interior from external fields*, but it does not shield the exterior from fields generated by charges placed *inside* the cage

### Field Between Parallel Conducting Plates

![[02 - Electric Field and Electric Forces II#Electric Field of Infinite Parallel Plates]]

Alternatively, using a Gaussian pillbox with one end cap inside one of the conducting plates and the other end cap in the space between the plates, Gauss's Law gives $EA = (\sigma A) / \epsilon_0$, which directly yields $E = \sigma / \epsilon_0$ for the field between the plates.
