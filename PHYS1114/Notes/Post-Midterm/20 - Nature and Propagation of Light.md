Dispersion is phenomenon where the speed of light in a material **depends on its wavelength**, causing different colors of light to ==refract at slightly different angles.==

### Fundamental Principles

When an electromagnetic wave, such as light, enters a new material from a vacuum, its **frequency remains the same**.

However, the **speed of light decreases** ($v<c$), and consequently, its **wavelength also decreases** ($Î»<Î»_0â€‹$).

### Index of Refraction

This is a *dimensionless* number that describes how fast light travels through a material.

$$
n = \frac{c}{v} = \frac{\lambda_{0} \ (\text{vacuum})}{\lambda \ \text{(material)}}
$$

### Chromatic Dispersion

In most materials, the index of refraction ($n$) is larger for shorter wavelengths ($\lambda_{0}$â€‹).

- Blue and violet light (shorter wavelengths) bend more than red light (longer wavelengths) when passing through a material like a prism.
- Materials like silicate flint glass çŸ½é…¸é¹½ç‡§çŸ³çŽ»ç’ƒ exhibit greater dispersion (a steeper curve) than materials like fluorite èž¢çŸ³.

## Formation of Rainbows ðŸŒˆ

Rainbows are an optical phenomenon caused by the ==dispersion of sunlight as it is refracted and reflected by raindrops.==

### Primary Rainbow

A primary rainbow is formed when sunlight enters a raindrop, refracts, undergoes **one internal reflection**, and then refracts again as it exits the droplet.

- Due to dispersion, the light is split into its spectrum of colors.
- The observer sees this rainbow at an angle between **40.8Â° (violet)** and **42.5Â° (red)** *relative to the direction opposite the sun.*
- The region outside the bright arc of the rainbow appears darker because raindrops in that area cannot send light to the observer's eyes.

### Secondary Rainbow

A fainter, secondary rainbow is sometimes visible outside the primary one. This is formed by light that undergoes **two internal reflections** inside the raindrop in addition to the two refractions.

- This secondary rainbow appears at a larger angle, from **50.1Â° (red)** to **53.2Â° (violet)**.
- Because of the extra reflection, the colors in a secondary rainbow are ==reversed== compared to the primary one.

**A key point to understand**: A rainbow is not a physical object. Its location and appearance depend entirely on the positions of the sun, the raindrops, and the observer.

## Polarization of Light

> reflection favors polarization âŠ¥ to the incident plane, refraction favors parallel.

Polarization describes the orientation of the electric field (E) oscillations in an electromagnetic wave.

**Linear Polarization**: An EM wave is linearly polarized if its electric field oscillates in a single direction. Most light sources, like the sun, are **unpolarized**, meaning their electric field vectors oscillate in random directions.

**Polarizing Filters (Polarizers)**: These filters, often made of a material called ==Polaroid==, have a polarizing axis that ==only allows== the component of the electric field **parallel to this axis to pass through**, absorbing the perpendicular component.

> When unpolarized light passes through an ideal polarizer, its intensity is **reduced by 50%**.  
> No matter the first angles.

### Malus's Law

Intensity (I) of linearly polarized light after it passes through a second polarizer (called an analyzer).

$$
I = I_{\text{max}} \cos ^2 \phi
$$

$I_{\text{max}}$ is the **initial intensity of the polarized light** and Ï• is the angle between the polarizing axes of the first and second filters.

### Polarization by Reflection (Brewster's Law)

When unpolarized light reflects off a ==non-metallic surface==, the reflected light is at least partially polarized.

At a specific angle of incidence, known as the **polarizing angle** or **Brewster's angle ($\theta_{p}$â€‹)**, the reflected light is **100% linearly polarized**.

At this angle, the reflected and refracted rays are **perpendicular** to each other. Brewster's law gives this angle:

$$
\tan \phi_{p} = \frac{n_{b}}{n_{a}}
$$

> $n_{a}$ is the index of refraction of the initial medium and $n_{b}$ is that of the reflecting surface.

## Light Scattering

Incident electromagnetic field causing the **charges within the molecule to oscillate** (absorption), which ==in turn radiates light in different directions (re-radiation).==

**Blue Sky**Â Air molecules scatter blue light more effectively than red light.Â The sky appears blue because we see the scattered light.

**Red Sunsets and Sunrises**Â During sunrise and sunset, sunlight travels a **longer path through** the atmosphere.Â Most of the blue light is scattered away, leaving the reddish light to reach our eyes.

**White Clouds**Â Water droplets in clouds are dense and scatter light of all wavelengths, which combine to appear white.

**Polarized Sunlight**Â Sunlight becomes partially polarized as it scatters in the atmosphere.Â For an observer on the ground, the scattered light from directly overhead will be polarized.

## Circular and Elliptical Polarization

Circular and elliptical polarization occur when two linearly polarized light waves, which are perpendicular to each other, combine.

### Circular Polarization

If the **two perpendicular waves have equal amplitudes and are 90 degrees out of phase**, the resulting electric field vector (E-vector) will have a constant magnitude and rotate in a circle.Â The direction of rotation (clockwise or counter-clockwise) depends on which wave leads or lags the other.

### Elliptical Polarization

If the amplitudes of the two perpendicular, 90-degree out-of-phase waves are not equal, the E-vector will trace out an ellipse instead of a circle.
