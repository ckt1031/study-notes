When viewing a piece of art that is behind glass, one often is affected by the light that is reflected off the front of the glass (calledÂ _glare_), which can make it difficult to see the art clearly. One solution is to coat the outer surface of the glass with a thin film to cancel part of the glare.

## Part A

If the glass has a refractive index of 1.61 and you use TiO2, which has an index of refraction of 2.62, as the coating, what is the minimum film thickness that will **cancel light** of wavelength 470 nm?

---

Reflective index of $\ce{TiO_{2}}$ **is larger than the glass**, air to coating has phase change.

$$
\begin{align}
\Delta \Phi_{\text{path}}   & = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda_{\text{film}}} (2t) = \frac{2\pi n_{\text{film}}}{\lambda_{\text{vaccum}}} (2t) \\
\Delta \Phi_{\text{reflection}}  & = \pi \\ \\
\Delta \Phi_{\text{total}}  & = \Delta \Phi_{\text{path}} + \Delta \Phi_{\text{reflection}} \\
 \pi (2m+1)& = \frac{2\pi n_{\text{film}}}{\lambda_{\text{vaccum}}} (2t) + \pi \\
2m & = \frac{2 n_{\text{film}}}{\lambda_{\text{vaccum}}} (2t) \\
m \lambda_{\text{vaccum}}  & = 2t n_{\text{film}} \\
 t& = 89.7 \ \mathrm{nm}
\end{align}
$$

## Part B

If this coating is too thin to stand up to wear, what other thicknesses would also work? Find only the three thinnest ones.

$$
\begin{align}
m \lambda_{\text{vaccum}}  & = 2t n_{\text{film}} \quad(\text{For m > 1})  \\
t_{2}  & = 179 \ \mathrm{nm} \\
t_{3}  & = 269 \ \mathrm{nm} \\
t_{4}  & = 359 \ \mathrm{nm}
\end{align}
$$
