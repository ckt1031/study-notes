Three polarizing filters are stacked, with the polarizing axis of the second and third filters at angles of $27.0^\circ$ and $65.0^\circ$, respectively, to that of the first. If unpolarized light is incident on the stack, the light has an intensity of $62.5 \ \mathrm{W/cm^2}$ after it passes through the stack.

If the incident intensity is kept constant but the **second polarizer is removed**, what is the intensity of the light after it has passed through the stack?

> To use Malus's Law correctly, we need the angle between the incident polarized light (which is at $27.0^\circ$) and the third filter's axis (which is at $65.0^\circ$).

$$
\begin{align}
I_{1}  & = \frac{1}{2} I_{0} \\
I_{2}  & = I_{1} \cos^2(27^\circ) \\
I_{3} & = I_{2} \cos^2(65^\circ) \\
I_{3} = 62.5  & = \frac{1}{2} I_{0} \cos^2(27^\circ) \cos^2(65 - 27^\circ) \\
I_{0}  & =  253.68 \ \mathrm{W / cm^2}
\end{align}
$$

$$
\begin{align}
I_{3,new}  & = \frac{I_{0}}{2} \cos^2 (65^\circ) \\
 & = 22.64 \ \mathrm{ W / cm^2}
\end{align}
$$
