A plate of glass $8.90 \ \text{cm}$ long is placed in contact with a second plate and is held at a small angle with it by a metal strip $7.40 \times 10^{-2} \ \text{mm}$ thick placed under one end. The space between the plates is filled with air. The glass is illuminated from above with light having a wavelength in air of $599 \ \text{nm}$.

How many interference fringes are observed **per unit length** in the reflected light?

$$
\begin{align}
\tan \theta = \frac{h}{l}  & = \frac{7.4\times 10^{-2} \times 10^{-3}}{8.9} \\
x \frac{h}{l} \times 2 & = m \times 599 \times 10^{-9} \\
\frac{m}{x}  & = 13.9 \ \text{fringes per unit length}
\end{align}
$$
