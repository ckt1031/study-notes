> Tutorial Question

A researcher measures the thickness of a layer of benzene (n = 1.50) floating on water by shining monochromatic light onto the film and varying the wavelength of the light. She finds that light of wavelength $575 \ \text{nm}$ is reflected most strongly from the film. What does she calculate for the minimum thickness of the film?

$$
\begin{align}
2t  & = \left( m+\frac{1}{2} \right) \lambda \\
t  & = \frac{1}{4} \lambda  \\
 & = \frac{\lambda_{0}}{4n} \\
 & = 95.8 \ \mathrm{nm}
\end{align}
$$
