Two large, parallel, metal plates carry opposite charges of equal magnitude. They are separated by a distance of $50.0 \ \mathrm{mm}$, and the potential difference between them is $380 \ \mathrm{V}$.

## Part A

What is the magnitude of the electric field (assumed to be uniform) in the region between the plates?

$$
\begin{align}
V  & = Ed \\
E  & = \frac{380}{50\times 10^{-3}} = 7600
\end{align}
$$

## Part B

What is the magnitude of the force this field exerts on a particle with a charge of 2.40nC?

$$
\begin{align}
F  & = qE = 2.4 \times 10^{-9} \times 7600
\end{align}
$$

## Part C

Use the results of part (b) to compute the work done by **the field on the particle** as it moves from the higher-potential plate to the lower.

$$
F=qE
$$

Since $q$ is positive, positive plate has higher potential, and E-field is the same direction of electric force, and E-field lines points from positive to negative, plus "from the higher-potential plate to the lower" means positive to negative, so E-Force same direction with displacement, so work done is positive.

$$
W = Fd = 1.82 \times 10^{-5} \times 50 \times 10^{-3} = 91\cdot10^{-8}
$$

## Part D

Compare the result of part (c) to the change of potential energy of the same charge, computed from the electric potential.

$$
\begin{align}
\Delta U = -W = -91 \times 10^{-8}
\end{align}
$$
