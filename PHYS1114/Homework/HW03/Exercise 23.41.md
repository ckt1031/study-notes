A metal sphere with radius $r_a$ is supported on an insulating stand at the center of a hollow, metal, spherical shell with radius $r_b$. There is charge $+q$ on the inner sphere and charge $-q$ on the outer spherical shell. Take $V$ to be zero when $r$ is infinite.

## Part A

Calculate the potential $V(r)$ for $r<r_{a}$. (Hint: the net potential is the sum of the potentials due to the individual spheres.)

---

$$
\begin{align}
V(r) - V(\infty)  & = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0}} \left( \frac{q}{r_{a}} -\frac{q}{r_{b}}\right)
\end{align}
$$

## Part B

Calculate the potential $V(r)$ for $r_a < r < r_b$.

For $r < r_{b}$, this region is _inside_ the outer conducting shell. As established in Part A, for any point inside a spherical conducting shell, the potential due to _that shell's charge_ is constant and equal to the potential on its surface.

$$
\begin{align}
V(r)  & =  V_{\text{inner sphere}}(r) + V_{\text{outer shell}}(r) \\
 & = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0}} \left( \frac{q}{r} -\frac{q}{r_{b}}\right)
\end{align}
$$

## Part C

Calculate the potential $V(r)$ for $r > r_b$.

---

For $r > r_b$, and thus $r > r_a$, this region is outside the inner sphere. So, the inner sphere behaves like a point charge $+q$ located at the center.  
The potential contribution from the inner sphere is $k \frac{q}{r}$.

==They cancel out each other.==

## Part D

Find the potential of the inner sphere with respect to the outer.

## Part E

$$
\begin{align}
E  & = - ()
\end{align}
$$
