Your electronics company has several identical capacitors with capacitance $C_1$ and several others with capacitance $C_2$. You must determine the values of $C_1$ and $C_2$ **but don't have access to $C_1$ and $C_2$ individually**. Instead, you have a network with $C_1$ and $C_2$ connected in series and a network with $C_1$ and $C_2$ connected in parallel. You have a $200.0 \ \mathrm{V}$ battery and instrumentation that measures the total energy supplied by the battery when it is connected to the network. When the *parallel* combination is connected to the battery, $0.195 \ \mathrm{J}$ of energy is stored in the network. When the *series* combination is connected, $0.0400 \ \mathrm{J}$ of energy is stored. You are told that $C_1$ is greater than $C_2$.

## Part A

CalculateÂ $C_{1}$.

$$
\begin{align}
0.195  & = \frac{1}{2} (C_{1} + C_{2}) \cdot 200^2 \\
0.04  & = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{C_{1} C_{2}}{C_{1} + C_{2}} \right) \cdot 200^2  \\
9.75 \times 10^{-6} & = C_{1} + C_{2} \\
C_{1} & = 9.75 \times 10^{-6} - C_{2} \\
0.04  & = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{(9.75 \times 10^{-6} - C_{2}) \cdot C_{2}}{9.75 \times 10^{-6}} \right) \cdot 200^2  \\
C_{2}  & = 2.81 \times 10^{-6} \ \text{or} \ 6.94 \times 10^{-6}
\end{align}
