In one experiment the electric field is measured for points at distances $r$ from a uniform line of charge that has charge per unit length $\lambda$ and length $l$, where $l \gg r$. In a second experiment the electric field is measured for points at distances $r$ from the center of a uniformly charged insulating sphere that has volume charge density $\rho$ and radius $R = 7.20 \ \mathrm{mm}$, where $r > R$. The results of the two measurements are listed in the table, but you aren't told which set of data applies to which experiment.

## Part F

Use the graph in part A to calculate Î» for the uniform line of charge.  
Express your answer to two significant figures and include the appropriate units.
