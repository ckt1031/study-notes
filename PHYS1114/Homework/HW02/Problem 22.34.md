In a region of space, there exists an electric field $\vec{E}$ that is directed along the $z$-axis and possesses a magnitude of $E = (840 \ \mathrm{N/(C \cdot m)})x$.

Find the flux for this field through a square in the $xy$-plane at $z=0$ and with side length $0.370 \ \text{m}$. One side of the square is along the $+x$-axis and another side is along the $+y$-axis.

Express your answer with the appropriate units.

$$
\begin{align}
\Phi_{E} & = \oint \vec{E} \cdot d \vec{A} \\
 & = \int^L_{0} \int^L_{0} 840x \cdot dx \cdot dy \\
 & = \int^L_{0} 420 L^2 dy \\
 & = \left[420 L^2 y \right]^L_{0} \\
 & = 420 L^3 \\
 & = 420 \times \left( 0.370 \right)^3 = 21.3 \ \mathrm{\frac{Nm^2}{C}} 
\end{align}
