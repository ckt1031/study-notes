Monochromatic light is at normal incidence on a plane transmission grating. The first-order maximum in the interference pattern is at an angle of 11.8 âˆ˜  
.

What is the angular position of the **fourth-order** maximum? Enter positive angle.

---

$$
\begin{align}
\theta_{1}  & = 11.8  = \sin^{-1} \left( \frac{\lambda}{a} \right) \\
\theta_{4}  & = \sin^{-1} (4 \sin (11.8)) \\
 & = 54.9^\circ
\end{align}
$$
