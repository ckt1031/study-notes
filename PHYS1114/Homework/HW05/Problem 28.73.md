Long, straight conductors with square cross sections and each carrying current $I$ are laid side by side to form an infinite current sheet (the figure). The conductors lie in the $xy$-plane, are parallel to the $y$-axis, and carry current in the $+y$ direction.

There are $n$ conductors per unit length measured along the $x-$axis.

## Part A

What are the magnitude of the magnetic field a distance $a$ below the current sheet?

$$
\begin{align}
\oint \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{l} &  = \mu_0 I_{enc} \\
\oint \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{l}  & = B L + BL + 0 + 0 = 2BL \\
 & = \mu_{0} N L I \\
B  & = \frac{\mu_{0} n I}{2}
\end{align}
$$

## Part B

What are the magnitude of the magnetic field a distance $a$ above the current sheet?

> Anywhere above or below the sheet, look at infinite sheet, B field is uniform
