A small sphere with mass $m$ carries a positive charge $q$ and is attached to one end of a silk fiber of length $L$. The other end of the fiber is attached to a large vertical insulating sheet that has a positive surface charge density $\sigma$.

Assume that the sphere is in equilibrium and find the angle that fiber makes with the vertical sheet.

Express your answer in terms of the variables $q$, $\sigma$, $m$, electric constant $\epsilon_0$, and acceleration due to gravity $g$.
