Two tiny spheres of mass $8.30 \ \mathrm{mg}$ carry charges of equal magnitude, $82.0 \ \mathrm{nC}$, but opposite sign. They are tied to the same ceiling hook by light strings of length $0.530 \ \mathrm{m}$. When a horizontal uniform electric field $E$ that is directed to the left is turned on, the spheres hang at rest with the angle $\theta$ between the strings equal to $58.0\degree$ (Figure 1).
