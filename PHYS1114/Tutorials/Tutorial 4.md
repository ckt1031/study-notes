An air-filled parallel-plate capacitor is connected to a battery and allowed to charge up. Now the battery is **disconnected** and a slab of dielectric material is placed between the plates of the capacitor. After this is done, we find that:

$$
\begin{align}
C_{f} = K C_{0} \quad V = \frac{V_{0}}{K} = \frac{Q}{C} \quad E = \frac{V}{d} \quad U = \frac{Q^2}{2C} 
\end{align}
$$

A. the energy stored in the capacitor had increased.  
B. the voltage across the capacitor had increased.  
C. the charge on the capacitor had increased.  
**D. the charge on the capacitor had not changed.**  
E. the voltage across the capacitor had not changed.

Capacitor $C_1$ is connected alone to a battery and charged until the magnitude of the charge on each plate is $4.0 \times 10^{-8}$ C. It is then removed from the battery and connected to two other capacitors $C_2$ and $C_3$ as shown. The charge on the positive plate of $C_1$ is then $1.0 \times 10^{-8}$ C. The charges on the positive plates of $C_2$ and $C_3$ are:

Their charge amount must be same as $4.0 \times 10^{-8} \ \mathrm{C}$, $Q_{2} = Q_{3} = (4.0 - 1.0) \times 10^{-8} / \mathrm{C}$
