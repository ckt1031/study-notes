## Warm-up Exercise 1

No net electric flux in a region **does not** mean there is no charge enclosed there and does not mean that no e-field there.

No net electric flux means no net charge, but there can be charges making total net charge zero, like $+Q - Q =0$.

For any closed surface drawn in this region, **any electric field line that enters the surface must also exit it**. Thus, the net electric flux is zero. However, the electric field within that region is clearly not zero; it is the uniform external field.
