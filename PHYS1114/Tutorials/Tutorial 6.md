## Final Review

### Question 4

A circular loop of wire lies in the plane of the paper. An increasing B-field points out of the paper, what is the direction of the induced current in the loop?

It oppose the increasing OUT of paper B-field, so induced B-field is INTO the paper with **clockwise** current direction.

### Question 11

$$
\begin{align}
2 \pi f  & =\omega = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ LC }} \\
2 \pi f \times 2  & = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ L \frac{C_{1}}{4} }}
\end{align}
$$
