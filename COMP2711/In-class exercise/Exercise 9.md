> In this problem, a black card is a spade or a club.  
> Remove one card from an ordinary deck of cards. What is the probability that it is an ace, a diamond, or black (spade or a club)?  
> Use the inclusion-exclusion formula to solve this problem.

Ace + Diamond + Black - (Ace + Diamond) - (Ace + Black) - (Diamond + Black) + (Diamond + Black + Ace)

$$
\frac{4}{52} + \frac{13}{52} + \frac{26}{52} - \frac{1}{52} - \frac{2}{52} -0 + 0 = 1- \frac{12}{52}
$$
