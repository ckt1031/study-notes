## Answer

Since we can only walk upward or walk rightwards.

In total we have ${11 \choose 5}$ available paths.

However, to avoid $C$, we need to calculate to available paths which passes through $C$: ${6 \choose 3} \times {5 \choose 2}$.

Overall, we have paths which do not pass through C: ${11 \choose 5} - {6 \choose 3} \times {5 \choose 2}$.
