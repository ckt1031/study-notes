## Question

A real number is rational if and only if it can be written as $\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers. Let $x$ and $y$ be two real numbers such that $xy \neq 0$.

> [!summary] Part A  
> Show, by contraposition, that if $x$ is irrational, then $x^{\frac{1}{5}}$ is irrational.

To assume $x^{\frac{1}{5}}$ is rational.

$x^{\frac{1}{5}} = \frac{a}{b}Â  (b \neq 0)$

$x = \frac{a^5}{b^5}$

Since $a$ and $b$ are integers, $a^5$ and $b^5$ must be integers

Therefore, if $x^{\frac{1}{5}}$ is rational, then $x$ must be rational.

> [!summary] Part B  
> Show, by contradiction, that if $x$ is irrational and $xy$ is rational, then $y$ is irrational

Assume $x$ is irrational and $xy$ is rational and $y$ is rational

let $y$ be $\frac{c}{d}$, $c$ and $d$ are integers, while $d \neq 0$.

$xy = x \frac{c}{d}$

Since $xy$ is rational, $\frac{xc}{d}$ is rational.

Given that $d$ is non-zero integer, so $xc$ must be rational.

If $x$ is irrational and $c$ is an integer, $xc$ cannot be rational.

Therefore $xy$ is irrational, contradicting the assumption that $x \in P \land xy \in Q$
