## Question 1

> [!info] Question  
> How many functions are there from a two-element set to a three-element set? Write down all the functions from the 2-element set $\{1, 2\}$ to the 3-element set $\{a, b, c\}$.

For the first element in our domain ($\{1, 2\}$), we have 3 choices in the codomain ($\{a, b, c\}$).  
For the second element in our domain, we also have 3 choices in the codomain.

So, we have **9 functions** from a two-element set to a three-element set.

$f_{1}: 1 \to a, 2 \to a$  
$f_{2}: 1 \to a, 2 \to b$  
$f_{3}: 1 \to a, 2 \to c$  
$f_{4}: 1 \to b, 2 \to a$  
$f_{5}: 1 \to b, 2 \to b$  
$f_{6}: 1 \to b, 2 \to c$  
$f_{7}: 1 \to c, 2 \to a$  
$f_{8}: 1 \to c, 2 \to b$  
$f_{9}: 1 \to c, 2 \to c$

## Question 2

> [!info] Question  
> How many functions are there from a 3-element set to a 2-element set? Write down all the functions from the 3-element set $\{1, 2, 3\}$ to the 2-element set $\{a, b\}$.

We have $2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8$ functions.

$f_{1} = 1 \to a, 2\to a,3\to a$  
$f_{2} = 1 \to a, 2\to a,3\to b$  
$f_{3} = 1 \to a, 2\to b,3\to a$  
$f_{4} = 1 \to a, 2\to b,3\to b$  
$f_{5} = 1 \to b, 2\to a,3\to a$  
$f_{6} = 1 \to b, 2\to b,3\to a$  
$f_{7} = 1 \to b, 2\to b,3\to b$  
$f_{8} = 1 \to b, 2\to a,3\to b$
