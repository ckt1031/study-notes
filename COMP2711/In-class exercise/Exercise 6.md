## Questions 1

$$Z_n= \{0, 1, 2, â€¦, n-1\}$$

> [!info] Question A  
> How many 5-element subsets does $Z_{10}$ have?

We have 10 terms here, so we have ${10 \choose 5} = 252$

> [!info] Question B  
> How many 5-element subsets of $Z_{10}$ contain at least one element in $Z_3$?

$252 - {7 \choose 5} = 231$

> [!info] Question C  
> How many 5-element subsets of $Z_{10}$ that contain two odd and three even numbers?

${5 \choose 2} \times {5 \choose 3} = 100$
