## Question 1

Determine whether each of these sets is finite, countably infinite or uncountable. No explanation is needed.

> [!info] Part A  
> The set $A\times B \times \mathbb{N}$, where $A = {1}$ and $B= {3, 4, 5, \dots, 2024}$

Since $\mathbb{N}$ is countable, while $A$ and $B$ are countable, so this is **countably infinite**.

> [!info] Part B  
> All bit strings not containing the bit $0$.

**Countably infinite**

> [!info] Part C  
> The set of rational numbers in the range $\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{200}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{100}\right)$.

**Countably infinite**

> [!info] Part D  
> The set of irrational numbers in the range $\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{200}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{100}\right)$.

**Uncountable**

> [!info] Part E  
> The set of non-intersecting disks on a plane (In other words, we can consider non-intersecting disks as circular coins with positive area that can have different radii. They are placed on a plane such that no two coins overlap.)

**Uncountable**

## Question 2

> [!summary] Question  
> Use proof by contrapositive to prove that for all sets $A$, $B$, $C$, if $A\cap B = \emptyset$ and $A\cap C = \emptyset$, then $A\cap (B\cup C) = \emptyset$. Other proofs are not accepted.

$$
(A\cap B = \emptyset) \land (A\cap C = \emptyset) \to (A\cap (B\cup C) = \emptyset)
$$

$$\text{Suppose } A\cap (B\cup C) \ne \emptyset$$  
$$(A\cap B) \cup (A\cap C) \ne \emptyset$$

Then, $A\cap B \ne \emptyset$ or $A\cap C \ne \emptyset$.  
This is to say, if $A\cap B = \emptyset$ and $A\cap C = \emptyset$, and thus $A\cap (B\cup C) = \emptyset$.

## Question 3

Chess is a famous board-game. the starting position of normal chess is shown in the picture below.

> [!summary] Question  
> Please calculate how we have exactly 960 valid starting positions.

In order to place the bishops, we have ${4 \choose 1} \times {4 \choose 1} = 16$.

Then, we have $8-2=6$ position left, then we are going to place the king wrapped with rooks. However, the king must be placed between rooks, so in the row with 6 seats, king is occupying one position between $2^\text{nd}$ and $5^{\text{th}}$ seat, so leaving $6-1=5$ seats left for rooks.

To calculate the possible arrangements for placing rooks with kings inside:

**Case 1**: King is placed in $2^\text{nd}$ seat in 6 seats, then we have ${1 \choose 1 } \times {4 \choose 1} = 4$ arrangements to rooks.

```
_ King _ _ _ _
```

**Case 2**: King is placed in $3^\text{rd}$ seat in 6 seats, then we have ${2 \choose 1} \times {3 \choose 1} = 6$ arrangements to place rooks.

```
_ _ King _ _ _
```

**Case 3**: King is placed in $4^\text{th}$ seat in 6 seats, then we have ${2 \choose 1} \times {3 \choose 1} = 6$ arrangements to place rooks.

```
_ _ _ King _ _
```

**Case 4**: King is placed in $5^\text{th}$ seat in 6 seats, then we have ${1 \choose 1 } \times {4 \choose 1} = 4$ arrangements to rooks.

```
_ _ _ _ King _
```

Therefore, we have in total $4 + 6 + 6 + 4 = 20$ possible arrangements to place the king and rooks.

For other 3 pieces left, but 2 knights are indistinguishable, we have ${3 \choose 2} = 3$ arrangements to place the remaining pieces.

In total, we have $16 \times 20 \times 3 = 960$.

## Question 4

> [!summary] Question  
> How many non-negative integer solutions exist for: $x+y +z = 48$ such that $x < y < z$?

We Have Number of Non-negative Integer Solutions Exist $x+y +z = 48$:

$$
{48+3-1 \choose 3-1} = {50 \choose 2} = 1225
$$

Above includes all possible arrangements by adding $x \neq y \neq z$ case, exactly 2 unknowns are equal case and 3 unknowns are equal case.

In order to find out the $x \neq y \neq z$ cases, so we need to remove the cases of exactly 2 equal and all is equal.

**Case 1**: 3 unknown are equal, only 1 solution, since $x=y=z=16$.  
**Case 2**: exactly 2 exactly are equal, the common number starts from $0$ to $24$, but we need to exclude $16$ since it is counted in case 1. Then, we have 24 choices for common numbers. We have 3 cases here: $x=y$, $x=z$, $y=z$, so we have $24 \times 3 = 72$ solutions.

For $x \neq y \neq z$ cases, we have $1225 - 72 - 1 = 1152$.

We need to ensure $x < y < z$, but giving 3 numbers to $x, y, z$, we have $3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6$ possible arrangements, but there is only $1$ possible arrangement for giving an increasing order.

Example: (We have 3 numbers, 13, 15 and 20, their sum $13+15+20=48$)

| #   | x   | y   | z   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | 13  | 15  | 20  |
| 2   | 13  | 20  | 15  |
| 3   | 15  | 13  | 20  |
| 4   | 15  | 20  | 13  |
| 5   | 20  | 13  | 15  |
| 6   | 20  | 15  | 13  |

Only #1 has valid $x < y < z$, so the number of non-negative integer solutions exist for: $x+y +z = 48$ such that $x < y < z$ is $\frac{{50 \choose 2} - 24 \times 3 - 1}{3!} = 192$.

## Question 5

> [!tldr] Give a combinatorial proof for the following equation:  
> $$\binom{\binom{n}{2}}{2} = 3\binom{n}{4} + 3\binom{n}{3}$$

Let $A$ be $\{ 1, 2, · · ·, n \}$.  

### Left Hand Side

The expression $\binom{\binom{n}{2}}{2}$ counts the number of ways to choose 2 subsets from a collection of all subsets of size 2, taken from the set $A = \{1, 2, …, n\}$.

### Right Hand Side

**Case 1**: we have one element in common of two chosen subsets.

- We have one duplicated number, so we have $4 - 1 = 3$ choices, then we have ${n \choose 3}$ ways to do this
- We have 3 ways to to divide them into two subsets of size two. for example: $\{1, 2, 3\}$, we could form $\{1, 2\}$ and $\{ 1, 3\}$, or $\{ 2, 3\}$ and $\{ 2, 1\}$, or $\{ 3, 1\}$ and $\{ 3, 2\}$.
- So, we have $3 \times {n \choose 3}$ ways.

**Case 2**: We have no common elements of two chosen subsets.

- We will have $n \choose 4$ ways to do this.
- Once we have the four elements, there are **3 ways** to divide them into two subsets of size two (for example, if we choose $\{1, 2, 3, 4\}$, we could form the subsets $\{1, 2\}$ and $\{3, 4\}$, or $\{1, 3\}$ and $\{2, 4\}$, or $\{1, 4\}$ and $\{2, 3\}$).
- So, we have $3 \times {n \choose 4}$ ways to choose two subsets with no common elements.

### Solution

Then, we combine case 1 and case 2 in right hand side, we will have:

$$\binom{\binom{n}{2}}{2} = 3\binom{n}{4} + 3\binom{n}{3}$$

## Question 6

> [!tldr] Question  
> Assume we have $14$ integers and assume $0$ is divisible by any number. Prove that there exists two numbers among them such that their sum or their difference is divisible by $25$.

For any integers, we have only $25$ possible remainders, $0,1,2,3,\dots,24$.

Our 14 integers are pigeons, then $25$ remainders are pigeonholes.

So, we have two cases:

- **Two numbers have the same remainders**: Their differences must be divided by 25, example: 101 and 51, their remainders are 1, and their difference is 50 which is divisible by 25.
- **Two numbers have non-equal remainders**:
	- By applying the Pigeon-hole principle, we have $25$ pigeonholes, from remainder $0$ to $24$.
	- However, we know that if two numbers which one's remainder is equal to 25 minus another's remainder
		- Example: $124$ and $151$, first's remainder is $24$ and next's remainder is $1$, which is $25-1$. Then $124+151=275$ which is definitely divisible by $25$.
	- Let us fill in the boxes, we can fill in 14 pigeonholes, but here we is, $\frac{25}{2}=12.5$, that's mean if we fill up the 14'th integer, we must find out a matching integers which remainder is equals to 25 minus the 14'th integer's remainder.
	- Then, Two numbers have non-equal remainders must have two numbers' sum which is divisible to 25.

Therefore there exists two numbers among them such that their sum or their difference is divisible by $25$.

## Question 7

A phone number of form $d_1 d_2 d_3 - d_4 d_5 d_6 d_7$ is memorable if the prefix sequence $d_1 d_2 d_3$ is exactly the same as either the sequence $d_4 d_5 d_6$ or $d_5 d_6 d_7$ or both. As an example $123-7123$ is memorable. $412-4214$ is **not** memorable. Assuming that each $d_i$ can be any of the ten decimal digits $0, 1, 2,…, 9$ find the number of different memorable telephone numbers.

- $A$: **Prefix matches the first three digits of the suffix**:
	- $10^{3} \times 10 = 10000$
- $B$: **Prefix matches the last three digits of the suffix**:
	- $10^{3} \times 10 = 10000$
- However, there are there are duplicated cases: ${A} \cap {B}$:
	- It is when all number is equal.
	- Then we have 10 solutions, from $000-0000$ to $999-9999$.
- Overall, we have $10000 + 10000 - 10 = 19990$ numbers.
