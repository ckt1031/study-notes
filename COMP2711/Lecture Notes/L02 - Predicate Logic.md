## Universal Quantifier

 - ==The domain must always be specified== (like positive integers? natural numebrs?) when a universal quantifier is used
- $\forall$ = For all, $P(x) = x > 5$, $\forall \times P(x) = \text{False}$, since not all $x$ is larger than 5, like 4.

## Existential Quantification

$$
\exists \times P(x) = P(x_1) \vee P(x_2) \vee P(x_3) \ \vee ... \vee P(x_n)
$$

- $\exists$, there exists at least one x in the domain, true for at least one is `True`, or one is `False` when with $\neg \exists$.
- False for all values becomes false.

## Restricted Domains

### Examples

1. ∀x (x2 ≥ x)
	- False, since if x is from 0 to 1

### With Quantifiers

- ∃x (P(x) ∧ Q(x))
	- "There exists an x such that P(x) and Q(x) are both true."
- ∀x (P(x) → Q(x)) where x ∈ A
	- "For all x in the set A, if P(x) is true, then Q(x) is also true."
