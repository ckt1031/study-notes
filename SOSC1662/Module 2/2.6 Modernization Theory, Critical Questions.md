Developing countries to "grow up" and mature economically like Western nations, they ==DO NOT need to adopt Western-style capital, technology, governance, and values.==

## Questioning the "Obvious" Explanations

> "Hong Kong's economic success is solely due to factors like good government, hard work, and technology" is overly simplistic, and it ignores the great technological and architectural achievements are not unique to the modern West.

Great Wall of China, the Taj Mahal in India, and the temples of Angkor Wat to demonstrate the advanced capabilities of ancient, non-Western civilizations.

## The Case of the Philippines: A Reversal of Fortune

In the 1950s, *the Philippines had the highest GDP in Asia after Japan* and was widely expected to become a regional economic leader.

Its advantages included a large English-speaking population, its status as the ==only Christian nation in Asia==, and influence from the industrial United States.

The economic situation was so favorable that ==women from mainland China and Hong Kong migrated to the Philippines to work as domestic helpers, a stark contrast to the present day.==

This reversal of fortune contradicts the **predictive power of Modernization Theory.**

## Failures and Rejection of the Western Model

> We cannot assume countries that are poor today are also poor in the past

Under the assumptions of Modernization Theory, given the right technology, government, values and capitals, the Philippines should develop or grow up and become just like the West.

Development programs designed to ==export Western technology and values== to poorer nations often failed.

Instead of fostering growth, these initiatives sometimes led to increased poverty, debt, and dependency on the West.

Furthermore, many developing nations in the 1950s and 1960s did not embrace the Western capitalist model as the theory would predict. Instead, **they actively rejected it**, ==opting for socialist, Marxist, or communist agendas.==

## The "Asian Values" Paradox

> "Asian values" are a primary driver of economic development may not be true, use mainland as an example.

**If Asian values really did explain economic development, which country would you have expected to develop first?**

---

Expected **Mainland China** to have developed first.

1. China is considered the "heartland of Confucianism" and the "Confucian motherland".
2. **Historical Preeminence 歷史優勢:** For much of recorded history, China was the most technologically advanced, populous, and economically powerful civilization in Asia, and arguably the world. It had sophisticated agricultural techniques, advanced metallurgy 冶金, printing, gunpowder, compasses, and extensive trade networks. ==If these values were the direct drivers, China should have maintained and accelerated this lead into industrialization.==
3. **Scale and Continuity:** China had a vast, unified empire for centuries, allowing for the widespread dissemination and reinforcement of these values across a massive population.

The reason why China isn't the first to develop is **not** because of a lack of Confucian values, but rather due to **historical and geopolitical factors** that disrupted its development.

1. **Resistant Political and Social Order**: Conservative confucian values $\implies$ poorly adapted to guiding industrial modernization. Disdain for merchants and physical labor, and its power base of rural elites resisted necessary reforms.
2. Post-War Socialist Planning
3. Orthodoxy vs. Periphery 正統與邊緣: Industrialization happens in places where commerce and international trade were more developed and accepted.

**Why did Hong Kong only develop in the 1950s but not earlier?**

> Hong Kong's economic development did not happen earlier because the specific conditions for its industrial transformation only converged in the 1950s

1. **Korean War**: Hong Kong relies on trade with China, and US has imposed sanctions on China during the Korean War, which led to a shift in trade patterns.
2. **Influx of Crucial Refugees**: The Communist takeover of the mainland led to a massive influx of refugees who provided the essential ingredients for industrialization. This group included:
	1. Experienced Industrialists -> invaluable managerial skills, particularly in textiles.
	2. A Willing Workforce -> a large supply of inexpensive labor.
	3. A New Class of Entrepreneurs -> the backbone of the industrial sector.
3. **Availability of Capital**: Hong Kong banks, seeking new ventures to ==replace their declining trade-financing business==, were eager to provide the necessary capital to the newly arrived Shanghai industrialists to build factories.

> Cannot be explained by Confucian values so simply, because it's not unique for Hong Kong and cannot explain why it only starts from 1950.

**World Systems Theory**, as a way to understand Hong Kong's specific developmental timeline, promising to explain why its economic takeoff occurred when it did.
