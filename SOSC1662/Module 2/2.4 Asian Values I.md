Role of cultural values, specifically "Asian values," in the process of industrialization, questioning whether they are a =="missing link"== in development.

## Key Summary

"Asian values" is a concept used to explain the economic success of East Asian nations, often linked to a shared Confucian heritage. These values are characterized by a strong work ethic, an emphasis on education, diligence, and devotion to the group over the individual.

The concept also includes a respect for hierarchy, the importance of family ties in business, and a sense of community and loyalty within organizations. This value system is supported by core institutions like a meritocratic bureaucracy and a demanding entrance exam system that helps instill discipline and select talent.  

「亞洲價值」是用來解釋東亞國家經濟成功的概念，通常與共同的儒家傳統息息相關。這些價值觀的特徵是強烈的職業道德、重視教育、勤奮以及對集體而非個人的奉獻。

此外，它還包括尊重等級制度、重視家庭關係在商業中的重要性，以及在組織內的社區意識和忠誠度。這個價值體係由一些核心製度支撐，例如精英官僚機構和嚴格的入學考試制度，這些制度有助於培養紀律和選拔人才。

## The Core Question: Is Technology Enough?

Japan and the "Four Little Dragons" (Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Singapore) share a Confucian heritage.

> Are Confucian values the key to a region's development?

It challenges the idea that technology alone is sufficient for industrialization, ==suggesting that a cultural "software" is needed to complement the technological "hardware."== The lecture probes the underlying motivations that ==drive people to work hard== and ==endlessly pursue more status and wealth.==

## The Parable of the Mexican Fisherman

1. An American businessman on vacation advises a fisherman to work longer hours to catch more fish.
2. He outlines a 15-to-25-year plan for the fisherman to buy bigger boats, then a fleet, open a cannery, and eventually move to New York to run a massive enterprise.
3. The ultimate goal, the American explains, is to sell the company stock, become a millionaire, and retire to a small coastal village. There, he could enjoy a relaxed life: sleeping late, fishing a little, and spending time with family and friends.
4. The fisherman replies that he is already living that exact life, putting into perspective the complex and arduous path ==many take to achieve a happiness that could be more simply obtained.==

### The Unfulfilled Promise of a Post-Work Society

John Maynard Keynes. Keynes theorized that by 2030, advances in technology would generate enough wealth for people to only need to work five hours per week.

This idea was prevalent in the 1980s, with many books predicting the **decline of the global labor force and the rise of a leisure society.**

However, the lecturer emphatically states, "IT NEVER HAPPENED!" This raises the sociological question of ==why people continue to work hard and accumulate wealth even when technology could theoretically free them from it.==

## Max Weber and the "Spirit of Capitalism"

**Weber's Question:** Weber sought to understand why industrial capitalism specifically emerged in 19th-century Europe and ==not in other advanced civilizations like China.==

**The Protestant Ethic:** He observed that the wealthiest and most successful capitalists of his time were largely ==Protestants==. He identified a set of values, the "Protestant Ethic," that he argued was uniquely suited to capitalism:

1. Saving money
2. Diligence in bookkeeping and accounting
3. Punctuality and sobriety 守時與清醒

**Religious Motivation:** According to Weber, this behavior was driven by a ==religious belief==, influenced by John Calvin, that worldly success and wealth were signs that a person was chosen by God for salvation.

**Secular Legacy:** While this specific religious belief has faded, ==the secular== drive to continuously produce and accumulate wealth remains deeply ingrained in modern culture.

### Why Isn't in China?

1. **Kinship Bonds:** ==Trust was heavily confined within family ties==, rarely extending to non-family members in a corporate or organizational setting.
2. **State Favoritism:** The government was characterized by personal favoritism, ==with people hired through connections rather than on merit==.
3. **Chinese Language:** Weber considered the time and effort required to master the Chinese writing system to be inefficient for modern commerce.
4. **Literary Education:** The educational system ==prioritized the study of philosophy and literature== over more practical subjects like business and science.

## Conclusion

Non-Western nations lacked the necessary values for industrial capitalism is "completely wrong."
