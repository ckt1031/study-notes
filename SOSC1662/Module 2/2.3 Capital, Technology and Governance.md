Industrialization of Hong Kong

## Initial Industry: Cotton versus Wool

Britain's early textile production was based on wool, a natural choice given the country's landscape and large sheep population. However, wool is **difficult to process with heavy machinery**. The British textile industry eventually shifted its focus to cotton.

Cotton proved to be a more durable fiber and was easily imported from colonies that utilized slave labor.

In contrast to Britain's initial focus on wool, ==Hong Kong began its textile industry using **cotton** from the outset.==

## Manufacturing Approach: Labor-Intensive vs. Capital-Intensive

The industrial economy of Great Britain was ==capital-intensive==, hallmarked by industries such as **coal, iron, steam, and shipbuilding.**

Hong Kong and the other "four little dragons" *did not have such natural resources*. Instead, Hong Kong's industrialization was =="labour intensive"==.

This was possible due to a ==large, poor migrant population==. Its primary products were electronic items and household goods, which required **few** natural resources and could be assembled easily in factories or even within the small confines of workers' homes.

## The Role of Government: A Planned Approach in a Supposedly Free Market

> Hong Kong as a purely market-driven, laissez-faire economy is a misconception. The government played a crucial role in shaping the industrial landscape.  
> In other words, Hong Kong is not TRUELY free market, but rather a "managed" market.

Britain's industrialization was fairly unplanned by its government.

However, the Hong Kong government was deeply involved in the ==territory's industrialization==, intervening in housing, education, leisure, and the arts.

### The 1953 Shek Kip Mei Fire 石硤尾大火

**The Event**: On Christmas Day in 1953, a fire broke out in a crowded squatter settlement in Shek Kip Mei. *The blaze lasted for six hours and left 53,000 residents, who were mostly migrants from mainland China, without homes.*

The disaster prompted one of the most extensive public housing programs in history. The colonial government ==cleared the squatter areas and built multi-story concrete residential buildings for the displaced population.==

Eventually this fire led to the establishment of the Hong Kong Housing Authority, which is responsible for public housing in the territory.

> Smart argues that plans to resettle squatters were already underway before the fire, as such fires were common at the time. It was in the British administration's interest to clear squatters off valuable Crown land and relocate them to public housing estates.

### Other Forms of Intervention

1. The government made land available to **manufacturing firms at below-market prices** to encourage the establishment of factories.
2. There is a long-standing tradition of the Hong Kong government ==assisting business elites==.
