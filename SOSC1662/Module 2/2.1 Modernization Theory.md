## Introduction to Modernization Theory and the East Asian "Miracle"

Until the 1950s, industrialization was largely considered a **Western phenomenon**.

The prevailing explanation for development was ==Modernization Theory==, which became popular after World War II. This theory assumed that the capitalist economies of **Britain and the United States** were the ultimate models of economic development.

However, the rapid and unexpected industrialization of Japan and the "Four Little Dragons"—Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Singapore—starting in the 1960s challenged this view. Their success was particularly puzzling because, at the time, ==they had few natural resources and their populations had relatively low levels of education.==

## A New Pattern: "Late, Late Industrialization"

1. Early Industrialization (Britain): This was an incremental process. Capital was generated internally, and the government played a minimal role.
2. Late Industrialization (Continental Europe): To catch up with Britain, these nations had to make sudden developmental spurts, requiring large-scale plants, significant capital investment, and a much larger coordinating role for the government.
3. Late, Late Industrialization (East Asia): By the 1950s, the technological and developmental gap was even larger. **Catching up required even higher levels of coordination**, technology absorption, and capital. This necessitated an activist government role to facilitate the process, but one that spurred a strong private sector rather than stifling it with rigid central planning. ==These nations could start with labor-intensive industries like textiles and consumer electronics, which required modest investment, before moving into more advanced sectors.==

## The End of an Era and Global Impact

1. Cheap labor ran out. Wages and currencies increased sharply. This made the cost advantage disappear.
2. Companies saved a lot of money. They moved production to other countries. Firms also focused on financial strategies. This made them less reliant on government help.
3. Service and finance jobs grew faster than factory work. This changed what society valued. People focused more on risky investments (asset bubbles). They also focused on buying things for their lifestyle.
4. Property and stock prices rose. This increased inequality. People demanded more political involvement. They also wanted better environmental protection. These demands made it harder to manage industry from the top.
