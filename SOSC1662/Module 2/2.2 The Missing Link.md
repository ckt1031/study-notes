## Challenging Conventional Wisdom on Development

### Geography and Climate

People think that favorable geography is a determinant of success.

Japan and Taiwan, are prone to natural disasters like earthquakes and floods.

Conversely, countries in the global south with extreme weather are often poorer, but ==this correlation is not causation==.

### Overpopulation

The idea that overpopulation is the main cause of poverty **is misleading**.

> China implemented a strict one-child policy under this assumption.

Some of the world's most densely populated areas are also the wealthiest. Like Hong Kong has a population density of 7,096 people per square kilometer

While the prosperous city-state of Monaco has a density of 26,337 people per square kilometer, sparsely populated countries like Mongolia and Sudan ==are not wealthy==.

### Lack of Capital

> Lack of capital is the primary barrier to development is too simplistic.

The Marshall Plan, under which the United States provided $13 billion to help rebuild Western European and Japanese economies after World War II, is cited as a successful example of capital injection, BUT this is politically motivated to prevent the spread of communism.

However, the success of the Four Little Dragons **was not solely dependent on initial capital**.

> The Marshall Plan: AT that time poor countries were embracing Marxism and Communism. The US hope that if they could improve poorer economies of other countries, so they were affluent and capitalist like the West, this would stop the spread of communism
