## Britain's Industrialization Vs Four Little Dragons

How was Britain's industrialization of the 18th and 19th Century different to the industrialization of the Four Little Dragons? Make a list of the differences.

---

- Time gap & available know-how – Britain was inventing entirely new machinery, while Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore could buy proven secondor fourth-wave technologies "off the shelf" and ==skip earlier stages==.
- Energy & raw materials – Early British factories drew on local coal and iron; ==the dragons had virtually no resources== and had to import almost everything, so they built export platforms to pay for it.
- Capital source – ==Britain financed itself internally==; the dragons relied first on US aid, emigrant remittances and later very high domestic savings orchestrated by the state.
- Labour supply – Britain mechanised to cope with scarce, skilled labour, whereas the dragons exploited abundant, disciplined, low-wage refugees and rural migrants in their first phase.
- Role of the state – Westminster largely let private inventors proceed, but late-late developers needed governments that **coordinated credit, technology licensing, training and infrastructure on a day-to-day basis.**
- Market sequence – Britain grew on domestic demand then exported; the dragons were too small for that path and internationalised from day one to achieve scale.
- Social costs – Victorian England endured decades of **urban squalor** before social policy arrived, while the dragons, learning from that precedent, introduced universal schooling, public housing or land reform much earlier in their growth cycles.

## What Did Singapore and Hong Kong Have in Common?

1. **British Colonial Heritage**: This gave them a familiarity with the ==English language== and Western culture that was advantageous for ==international commerce==.
	1. English-language courts
	2. Links to global shipping
	3. Insurance
	4. Banking networks
2. **Tiny domestic markets**: Small populations and local consumer markets to support large-scale local industries. Making them to concentrate on a ==few industrial sectors== that could compete **in the world market from the very beginning**.
	- Virtually no agriculture and no natural resources
	- Entrepot trade
	- Export manufacturing
3. Overwhelming majority of residents were ethnic Chinese.
4. ==Shared Wartime Experiences==: During **World War II**, the defeat of British forces by the Japanese destroyed both cities. Both had also been **headquarters** for large numbers of Japanese troops. Later, both benefited from the **economic stimulus of providing services to allied troops** during the Korean and Vietnam wars

## Why US Share Technology to the Four Little Dragons?

**Cold-War security:**

> Washington wanted non-communist Asian allies to prosper so it removed earlier British-style export bans and channelled military, technical and student-exchange programmes to them.

**Confidence gap:**

> In the 1950s America was technologically so far ahead that it did not fear competition and therefore tolerated licensing, foreign direct investment and large G.I. procurement contracts that transferred know-how.

## How Are Singapore and Hong Kong Different

**Political Systems**:

> Hong Kong stayed a colony until 1997  
> Singapore became an independent republic in 1965. Singapore's extends to nearby ASEAN countries, especially Malaysia and Indonesia.

**Economic Systems**:

> Hong Kong practised the world's **purest laissez-faire**: low taxes, minimal industrial planning and reliance on family entrepreneurs.  
> Singapore ran perhaps the most activist state in the region: an Economic Development Board, government-linked corporations, wage-raising drives and a huge compulsory-savings fund that financed factories, shipyards and public housing.

**Source of firms**:

> In Hong Kong growth came from refugee-run SMEs that migrated across the border  
> Singapore deliberately recruited multinationals for capital and markets and staffed many large enterprises with civil-servant managers.

**Residents**

> Hong Kong's population was overwhelmingly Cantonese, with a small percentage of Westerners and Indians.  
> Singapore's population was more diverse: 75% Chinese (split into major groups who found each other's dialects unintelligible.), 15% Malay, and 7% Indian, each with its own language and tradition.

**Economic Policies**:

> Hong Kong's economic policies were based on free-market principles, with minimal government intervention.  
> Singapore's policies were characterized by **active government intervention** in the economy, including state-owned enterprises and extensive social welfare programs.

**Political Decision-Making**:

> Hong Kong's political decisions were often made behind closed doors by colonial officials, with little public input or debate.  
> Singapore's leaders engaged in public debates and discussions, fostering a more transparent political environment.

## The Impact of East Asian Industrialization Outside East Asia

The success of the East Asian Economies has stimulated people around the world to raise their expectations concerning economic improvement and has changed the nature of analysis concerning how best to improve their nations' economies.

### Demonstration Effects for Late Developers

Their record of rapid catch-up, export-led growth under activist but market-compatible states, provided an **alternative policy template** that influenced industrial and trade strategies from ==Southeast Asia to Latin America== (inference based on the prominence the book gives to their "pillar" status and technology diffusion).

> Also avoids what some saw as Western decadence and crime while allowing local customs to survive.

### New Industrial Standard

The extraordinary competitiveness of Japanese companies is forcing Western companies around the world to learn from Japanese technology and management techniques (e.g., quality control, and inventory management). In the US, companies start cooperating on research projects and experimenting with new relationships with suppliers to improve quality and speed up production time.

### New Financial Centers and Capital Exporters

Tokyo and Hong Kong joined New York and London as **global financial hubs, intermediating shipping finance, foreign‐exchange dealing and equity issues for firms from every continent.**

Surging current-account surpluses turned the dragons from aid recipients into creditors: by the late 1980s the two largest official foreign-currency hoards in the world were held by ==Japan and Taiwan, and East-Asian== companies **controlled a growing slice** of North-American and European assets.

## Industrialization of HK Vs Singapore

Singapore's success came less from the raw energy of individual enterprises and ==more from the deliberate planning of bureaucratic managers and multinational executives==. Hong Kong **government played a smaller role** and individual entrepreneurs a far more significant role.

==Hong Kong's industrialization was more volatile and personal==, while Singapore's was more orderly and predictable (tightly controlled).

## HK, SG, JP, SK and Taiwan Common

1. Confucian heritage
2. Benefited from offering rear services to the Allied troops during the Korean and Vietnam wars.
3. New governments established after WWII in Japan. The Little Dragons were less beholden to the traditional elites and, therefore, ==freer to make policy decisions without considering their interests.==
4. Got sense of economic urgency after WWII since their populations increased a lot while geographic areas and resources were limited
5. New labour force, eager to work and improve its skills to meet the industry's needs
6. Japanese model and Japanese technology and investment
7. Substantial heritage, including a written language that used Chinese characters.
8. Densely populated (a large young workforce) and short on natural resources.
9. Very tight control over crime.
