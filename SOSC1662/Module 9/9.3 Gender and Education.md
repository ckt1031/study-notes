## Historical Context: The Era of "Working Daughters"

**Past Family Strategy:** In the 1960s and 1970s, Hong Kong's patriarchal family structures prioritized sons' education.

- **Sons:** Viewed as economic assets to be invested in and ==were sent to top schools==.
- **Daughters:** Encouraged to leave school early to *work in factories or help at home* to ==finance their brothers' education.==

> Sociological Research: This phenomenon was documented by sociologist Janet Salif in her book, "The Working Daughters of Hong Kong," based on her study of 28 working daughters.

**Consequence:** This created a large group of aging, unskilled female workers in the labor market decades later (30 years later).

## The Modern Shift: Female Dominance in Higher Education

**Current Statistics:** Today, female students outnumber male students in UGC-funded higher education programs in Hong Kong. In the 2022/23 academic year, *51.8% of students were female.*

**Global Trend:** This is part of a global phenomenon seen in many countries, including the United States, where nearly 60% of all college degrees went to women in 2020.

|:---------------------------------- |:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Assessment emphasis on language** | 3 of 4 HKDSE compulsory subjects rely on language proficiency—an area where girls, on average, outperform boys.                                            |
| **Reading habits**                  | School studies show a positive correlation between number of books borrowed and grades; girls borrow more books.                                           |
| **Teacher perceptions**             | Girls considered more responsible and patient.<br>Boys excel in maths/science but these count for fewer internal-assessment marks in many primary schools. |

## The "Problem" with Boys: Underachievement in Schools

### Sociologist Michael Kimmel's Observations

- Boys 4 times likelier to be sent to child psychologists, 9 times likelier to be labelled hyperactive.
- 80% of special-ed emotional-disabled cases are boys.
- Overconfidence: boys choose classes too difficult, harming grades.

### The Abolition of Gender-Based School Allocation (HK)

**Previous System:** Secondary schools used to have separate queues for boys and girls, *with places divided equally.*

**The Change:** In 1998, a parent's complaint to the ==Equal Opportunities Commission== led to a court case. The commission argued successfully that school places ==should be based on merit, not gender.==

**The Result (Post-2002):** The separate queues were abolished. This led to a ==sharp increase in female students at elite schools==, with some schools having up to 80% girls.

## Is the System Biased Against Boys?

### Perspective 1: Christina Hoff Sommers - "The War Against Boys"

1. It is a "bad time to be a boy."
2. The classroom is seen as a =="feminizing environment"== that requires boys to sit still and be cooperative when they would rather compete.
3. The educational system labels ==boys' natural behaviors as deviant or sick.==

### Perspective 2: Michael Kimmel - "Ideology of Traditional Masculinity"

1. Kimmel disagrees that schooling discriminates against boys.
2. He argues it is the **"ideology of traditional masculinity" 傳統男性氣概意識形態** that hinders boys' success.

**Key Argument:** Boys perceive success in school, especially in subjects like arts and humanities, as "feminine." To succeed is seen as "not acting like a real boy."

**"Gender Policing":** Boys enforce these gender norms among themselves. When a boy excels in "feminine" subjects, he is often insulted with terms like "sissy," "girly," or "gay" to challenge his masculinity.

## Persistent Gender Segregation and Bias

### Segregation in Academic Subjects

Despite their overall success, women in higher education are **concentrated in fields like Education (72.6%), Arts and Humanities (70.6%), and Health (65.8%).**

Men continue to dominate in **Engineering and Technology (71.1%) and Sciences (62.3%).**

### Institutional Gender Bias (Work of Choi Po King)

**Cultural Transmission:** In the mid-1990s, sociologist Choi Po King found that science textbooks often used examples (from sports, war, industry) that appealed more to boys. Girls were often only encouraged to pursue science if their grades were exceptionally high, a standard not applied to boys.

**Institutional Context:** While teachers were often female, school principals and head teachers were predominantly male, ==reinforcing the idea that "men are in charge."==

### Gender Bias in University Leadership

An institutional analysis at HKUST revealed that **men predominated on most major university committees.**

Women were also highly underrepresented as presidents of student societies.  

The recent positive development of Nancy Ip's appointment as president of HKUST, a significant achievement at a science and technology university.
