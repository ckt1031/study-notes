<span style="font-size: 20px">To what extent has there really been a role reversal in the household division of labour among these families? i.e. Have the fathers really sacrificed their careers to look after their children in the way that mothers do?</span>

While the number of full-time male home-makers in Hong Kong has increased significantly in recent years, from 14,800 in 2010 to 38,700 in 2020, this trend does not represent a full role **reversal in the division of labor**.

The change, though "dramatic," started from a very small base. In 2020, **women still constituted the vast majority of full-time home-makers**, with 615,600 females in this role. Furthermore, a much larger percentage of economically inactive women cite "engagement in household duties" as the reason compared to men (37.3% of women vs. 3.9% of men).

The documentary "House Husbands" suggests that fathers have not sacrificed their careers to the same extent that mothers traditionally have. ==Rather than completely leaving the workforce, they adapt their careers to accommodate childcare.==

<span style="font-size: 20px">How do other people react to the stay-at-home fathers?</span>

The reaction of other people to stay-at-home fathers is mixed and heavily dependent on ==whether the father is still perceived as a financial contributor.==

**General Public Assumption:** The default societal expectation is that men should be at work. One father recounts how people in his neighborhood see him with his children and ask, "Mr. Chan, today you don't have to go to work?" or "Are you on holiday?".

**Conditional Acceptance:** The acceptance of stay-at-home fathers is often conditional on their ability to earn money.

- The same father explains that people are accepting of a "money-making stay-at-home dad" (" 賺錢的臭小公 ").
- However, if they perceive him as not earning an income, they suspect he is "living off his wife" (" 吃老婆飯的, 吃軟飯的 "). He notes that in such cases, their "eyes and facial expressions would be completely different".

**Peer Admiration:** Other parents, particularly those who understand the challenges of childcare, react with admiration. One parent in the documentary expresses that he has "a lot of courage" and is impressive for his "energy," acknowledging that looking after two children is very difficult.
