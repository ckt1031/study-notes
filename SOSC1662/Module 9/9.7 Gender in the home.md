## The Unequal Division of Labor

### Statistical Evidence in Hong Kong

A significant percentage of **economically inactive** women (37.3%) cite ==engagement in household duties== as the reason, compared to only 3.9% of men.

Men are responsible for a **smaller share of housework.**

**Approximately two-thirds (68.3%) of males** aged 15 and over **perform 20% or less of the housework**, compared to 36.2% of females in the same age group.

### Perception vs. Reality

- Men tend to ==overestimate== their contribution to housework.
- A Synovate survey revealed that while 75% of women believe they do the majority of housework, ==only 60% of men concur.==
- Furthermore, 22% of men feel that housework is shared equally, ==a view held by only 14% of women.==

## Explanations for the Inequality

### The "Resources" Argument and Its Flaw

Historically, it was believed that men, **possessing more resources** (money, prestige, better jobs), ==exchanged these for women's domestic labor==, as women were dependent on them.

However, this theory is challenged by the finding that when men earn _less_ than their female partners, they tend to do even _less_ housework.

### Masculinity and Housework

Men whose earnings are **lower** than their partners may **feel their masculinity is threatened.**

Performing housework can **make these men feel "less of a man".**

**Women's jobs** are often viewed as **"supplementary"** or less critical than men's, reinforcing this dynamic.

## Arlie Hochschild View

### The Second Shift

> American sociologist Arlie Hochschild conducted a study involving interviews with 15 couples and observations in 12 homes.

She concluded that **when paid employment, childcare, and housework are combined**, women work ==approximately 15 more hours **per week** than men==. This equates to an extra month of work each year.

This additional work, performed _after their regular job_, is termed the =="second shift"==.

### How Time is Accounted For

Women feel a ==greater sense of responsibility== for the home and children. They manage frequent, daily tasks like cooking dinner and overseeing doctor's appointments.

Men's contributions are ==often less frequent==, such as changing the car oil every six months or repairing appliances when they have time.

**Women are more likely to "juggle" multiple tasks at once, while men tend to focus on one thing at a time.**

### The Stalled Revolution

Hochschild argues that while women have _adapted to economic pressures by entering the workforce in large numbers_, the attitudes of men and the structure of workplaces **have not kept pace.**

==Men remain reluctant to equally share housework==, and ==companies generally do not provide support like daycare.==

This disparity between women's changing roles and the **slow pace of change in men** and institutions is called the "Stalled Revolution".

## Mechanisms That Perpetuate Inequality (Hochschild)

### Gender Strategy

Couples often rationalize prioritizing the man's career because he typically earns more. This leads to ==women agreeing to take on more responsibilities at home.==

### Economy of Gratitude

Many women in the study felt ==a sense of gratitude== to their husbands for "letting them" work outside the home. To repay this ==perceived "emotional debt,"== they would take on **a larger share of housework and childcare.**

### Family Myths

Couples often create and sustain the ==belief== that **their division of labor is fair**, even when it is demonstrably unequal. By not acknowledging the inequality, they allow it to continue.

## The Role of Domestic Workers in Hong Kong

> Does Hired Help Solve the Problem?  
> Research conducted in Hong Kong by Groves and Lui (2012) explored whether employing domestic workers resolves the conflict for working women.

The availability of paid domestic help has increased, but the **"gendered meanings" we attach to housework and childcare have not fundamentally changed.**

Society still largely **expects women to be the primary caretakers at home**, even when they participate equally in the workforce.

### Mothers

Often believed that domestic workers provided ==subpar childcare== and felt the need to "==compensate==" by arranging extra activities for their children.

==Felt== accused by fathers and the media of ==abandoning their maternal role.==

==Felt a sense of responsibility== for the well-being of the domestic worker, in addition to their own family.

### Fathers

Viewed the domestic worker as a =="gift"== they had given ==to their wives.==

Used the presence of a domestic worker as a ==rationale== to do even _less_ housework than before.

==Were often critical of their wives==, perceiving them as **ungrateful or overly demanding** of the domestic worker.
