<span style="font-size: 20">According to the article, what is the reason why more females are studying at Hong Kong universities than males?</span>

1. Boys are falling behind because assessment in ==education emphasizes language skills==, which girls are often better at.

![[9.3 Gender and Education#Extra Observations]]

2. Separated queues abandoned, converted to merits-based. (Bad for male due to point 4)
3. Three of the four compulsory subjects (LS before 2024, CSD for post-2024), depend on language ability, more favorable for girls, isn't fair to boys as they may be more creative than girls.
4. Teachers favor girls as they are more responsible, meticulous and patient (Assessment Bias)
	1. **The current assessment system does not take into account of math, science and logic (excel in fields of boys)**
	2. Internal results are used for central allocation, teachers assign more marks to language subjects while a half to math and general knowledge.
	3. Strong language skills (More girls) have a better chance of getting into elite secondary schools.
5. Society's norms about masculinity, good at cultural activities -> unmasculine.
