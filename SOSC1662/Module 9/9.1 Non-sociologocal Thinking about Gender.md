- Sociology asks **how social structures, culture & power shape gender**.
- **Non-sociologocal Thinking**: Assumes gendered behaviors and outcomes are explained by fixed, biological differences.
- Became popular in the late 19th century with the rise of ==scientific authority== over religion.

## Late-19th-century Biological Determinism

### Charles Darwin

In _The Descent of Man 《人類的由來》_, he argued that women's mental disposition is characterized by "greater tenderness and lesser selfishness," while men are **naturally competitive and ambitious**.

### Herbert Spencer (Social Darwinist)

Was highly critical of women, suggesting that a "high-pressure education" made them "incapable of breastfeeding" (平胸女孩 flat-chested girls).

### Gustave Le Bon (Psychologist)

Claimed women are an "inferior form of human evolution 低等的進化形式 " ranking them closer to children and "savages 野蠻人 " than to civilized adult men.

## Modern Manifestations of Biological Determinism

**Career vs. Motherhood**: Persistent societal idea that women who pursue careers may be _neglecting their children_, implying working mothers "harm children".

**"Leftover Women"**: A term used in China to shame educated, unmarried women, stemming from anxieties ==about declining fertility rates==, moral panic, not biology.

### Doubts in Academia and Tech

#### Lawrence Summers (former Harvard President)

Suggested that the underrepresentation of women in science and engineering is due to issues of "intrinsic aptitude" 內在天賦.

#### James Damore (former Google employee)

Argued in a memo that psychological gender differences, such as ==higher average neuroticism 神經質程度== in women, could explain why few women are in leadership or high-stress tech jobs.

## Counterarguments and Sociological Perspective

**Historical Counter-Evidence**: At least up until the 1980s, women played a dominant and critical role in the history of ==computer programming and code-breaking==, which contradicts the idea of an intrinsic male aptitude for tech.

**The Nature vs. Nurture Debate**: This is the core of the issue: ==to what extent are we products of genetics== versus our environment and socialization?.

> Biology **is not dismissed entirely**, but its role is considered much more complex and intertwined with social factors than non-sociological theories admit.

We are products of an _interaction_ between our genes and our environment. It is difficult to separate these two influences.

- **Alcoholism**: A gene for addiction is only expressed in an environment where alcohol is present.
- **Obesity**: A genetic predisposition for obesity is more likely to manifest in a society with abundant cheap, fast food.
- **Cancer**: While some cancers have genetic links, lifestyle and environmental factors play a crucial role in whether an individual develops the disease.
