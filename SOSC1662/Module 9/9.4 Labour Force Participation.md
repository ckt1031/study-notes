## The Paradox of Female Advancement

Paid workÂ **reduces women's economic dependence on men**Â and is a core arena where gender inequality becomes visible.

High-profile female leaders (e.g., ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ Kamala Harris, ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Angela Merkel) can give theÂ *illusion*Â of parity, yet statistics show **persistent under-representation, especially in Hong Kong politics and the judiciary.**

## Underrepresentation in Government and Judiciary

### Legislative Council (2022-2025)

|                             | MAX | Seats for F | Percentage |
| --------------------------- | --- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Geographical Constituencies | 20  | 4           | 20%        |
| Functional Constituencies   | 30  | 0           | 0%         |
| Election Committee          | 40  | 13          | 32.5%      |
| Overall                     | 90  | 17          | 19%        |

### The Judiciary

Women are significantly underrepresented across the court system.

**Court of Final Appeal:** There are currently no women serving on this court. Although *Baroness Hale was the first female judge*, she resigned.

|                         | Max | Seats for F | Percentage |
| ----------------------- | --- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Court of Appeal         | 15  | 3           | 20%        |
| Court of First Instance | 24  | 9           | 37.5%      |
| District Court          | 44  | 6           | 15.6%      |

## Labor Force Participation (LFP) Rates

1. People aged $\geq 15$ who are working or actively seeking work.
2. $\mathrm{LFPR} = \mathrm{LF / Working - Age \ Population \times 100\%}$

While women now participate in the workforce in numbers almost equal to men, their **participation patterns differ significantly over their lifetimes.**

| Gender | 2010      | 2020      | Diff      | Diff to Gender (2010) | Diff to Gender (2020) |
| ------ | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| Women  | **48.2%** | **49.6%** | **+1.4%** | -20.3%                | **-16.6%**            |
| Men    | 68.5%     | 66.2%     | -2.3%     | ---                   | ---                   |

### The "M Curve"

"M" standing for mother, suggesting that child-rearing responsibilities are a primary reason for this drop.

| Age Group | Female LFP | Male LFP | Interpretation                                                           |
| --------- | ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 25-29     | **85.0%**  |          | Female peak.                                                             |
| 30-34     | 75.9%      |          | Many women exit for childbearing/family.                                 |
| 35-39     |            | 95.1%    | Both sexes taper towards retirement, men remains fairly constant in LFP. |

**Women:** Participation also peaks at ages 25-29 but then steadily declines throughout their thirties and forties, and never fully recovers to the peak level.

### Sociological Explanations

1. **Caregiving expectations** push women out of full-time work during child-rearing years, ==men's careers remain continuous.==
2. **Limited childcare**, long working hours, and cultural norms about maternal caregiving deepen the M-curve.
3. Even when women re-enter, ==they may shift into part-time or lower-paid roles==, setting up the gender pay gap

## Generational Change in Female Employment

1. Nearly all **female university students** intend to have a ==full-time career after graduation==.
2. However, **only about half** of their mothers **had a continuous full-time job for eight years or more.**
3. Dramatic change in expectations and opportunities for women in the workforce within a short period.
