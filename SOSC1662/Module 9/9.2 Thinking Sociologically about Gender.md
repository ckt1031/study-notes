## Core Sociological Questions about Gender

Sociology as a discipline poses critical questions to **challenge common-sense assumptions about gender.**

### Exaggerated Differences between Men and Women

Bestselling self-help book "Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus" explains the viewpoint that men and women are *fundamentally different*. A major problem: overstates differences, distracting from the significant similarities and overlaps between genders. Ignores the vast differences *within* a gender group.

#### Mathematical Ability

While there may be more male mathematical geniuses, the variation in math ability *within* the male population and *within* the female population is often ==greater than the average difference *between* them==.

==Social factors, such as social class and nationality==, **can have a greater impact** on mathematical ability than gender. For instance, high-income women tend to outperform low-income men in mathematics.

> Class can matter more than gender for achievement.

**International comparisons show inconsistent gender advantages.** Boys only perform better in math in about half of developed (OECD) nations. In ==Iceland==, girls significantly outperform boys, and in Japan, girls outperform American boys.

### Meaning of Biological Differences

Sociology is less concerned with biological facts themselves and more ==with the cultural *meaning* and value we assign to them.==

#### Brain Size

It is a biological fact that, on average, **men's brains are 9% larger than women's brains.**

However, this size difference does not inherently mean men are more intelligent. Using an analogy, **Arnold Schwarzenegger** is larger than Albert Einstein, **but not considered more intelligent.**

Similarly, early computers took up entire rooms, while modern computers fit in our hands. The smaller, newer computer is far more powerful and efficient, **suggesting that a smaller brain could potentially be more efficient.**

### Differences Cause Inequality or Inequality Cause Differences?

The sociological perspective suggests that treating people differently (**inequality**) can create and **amplify differences in their behavior and outcomes.**

Keeping someone in a dark room impairs vision regardless of genetics (thought experiment) illustrates how the ==environment (or social treatment)== can produce what might otherwise be ==mistaken for an innate difference.==

## Gender Socialization: Learning Gender Roles

Gender socialization is the process through which individuals learn the social expectations and norms associated with their gender.

People do not try to be sexist. Deeply ingrained cultural stereotypes about gender guide our behavior from the moment we are born. They shape a child's experiences and environment. This encourages them to follow prescribed gender roles. ==Often, no one realizes this is happening (Unconscious).==

### Key Distinction: Sex vs. Gender

**Sex** refers to the biological and physical characteristics that distinguish males and females (e.g., genitalia 生殖器, hormones, height differences).

**Gender** refers to the cultural meanings, expectations, and roles assigned to sex (e.g., women are expected to be *nurturing*, men are expected to be *competitive*).

### Mechanisms of Gender Socialization (Ann Oakley)

**Peer Groups** – enforcement of masculinity norms (e.g., boys avoid "girly" activities).

**Manipulation:** Parents and others treat children differently based on their gender from a very young age. For example, mothers often pay more attention to a **girl's hair and dress**.

**Canalization (Toy-Giving):** Children are channeled toward certain toys and activities. Girls are often given dolls and domestic objects, while boys are given guns and building blocks.

**Verbal Appellations:** Using different words and labels to describe similar behaviors, such as calling a girl "good" and a boy "*naughty*" for the same action.

**Activity Exposure:** Children are exposed to different activities and media content ==based on their gender.==

### The Power of Media and Advertising in Gendering Toys

**The marketing industry** spends billions of dollars annually targeting youth, playing a critical role in socialization. Young children are particularly vulnerable as ==they often cannot distinguish between entertainment and commercials.==

**Commercials for Boys:** Emphasize power, action, destruction, competition, control, and aggression. They encourage boys to build, be creative, and construct new worlds, ==fostering confidence==. These ads ==rarely show boys as nurturing or caring.==

**Commercials for Girls:** Focus heavily on child-rearing, domestic work, beauty, popularity, and appearance over intelligence. Toys marketed to girls are often less imaginative and ==lack the creative==, constructive elements found in boys' toys.

**Technology Marketing:** Technology is marketed differently, with boys being encouraged to play online adventure games and be heroes, while ==girls are offered "hot," purple computers for learning about fashion and cooking==. This may contribute to the significant gender disparity in technology fields, where only **3% of open-source programmers and 11.5% of video game developers are women.**

## Gender a "social structure"?

It organizes resources, power and expectations across institutions (family, work, state), constraining individual choices beyond personal attitudes.
