Two Types of Explanations for Poverty:

1. Individualistic (focus on the poor themselves)
2. Societal (focus on broader social structures).

## Historical vs. Modern Perceptions of Inequality

Historically, inequality was seen as a natural or divine order.

In contrast, modern wealthy figures are portrayed **as relatable**, leading ordinary people to internalize ==blame for their own== lack of wealth.

In the past, monarchs and aristocrats 君主和貴族 were seen as fundamentally different from ordinary people, and their immense wealth was accepted as ==a natural part of the social order.==

Today, media and the internet provide access to the lives of billionaires like Mark Zuckerberg, **often showing them in "ordinary" settings**, such as making their own breakfast in a simple kitchen.

This perceived ordinariness and relatability encourages people to compare themselves directly to the ultra-wealthy. It fosters a sense of *self-blame*, prompting questions like, "Why couldn't I have done that?" and leading individuals to attribute their own financial struggles to personal shortcomings like not working hard enough or managing time better.

## 19th Century Social Darwinism

Thinkers like Herbert Spencer and William Sumner applied evolutionary ideas to society

**Poverty was a result of individual failings** (e.g., laziness, bad decisions).

They ==opposed welfare==, believing it interfered with the "natural" order.

## Political Manifestations

The individualistic view was championed by conservative leaders like Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s and was associated with the term "welfare queens".

> "welfare queens" -- young people allegedly living comfortably on state benefits.

This perspective was also held by the first government of the HKSAR *during the Asian financial crisis*, amid **fears that Hong Kong would become a "welfare society".**

## Critique of the Individualistic Approach in Hong Kong

individualistic view is not very applicable to Hong Kong because:

1. Many poor are unable to work due to ==age or childcare duties.==
2. A large number of the "working poor" exist, where households are in poverty despite having employed members, pointing to ==low wages as a primary cause.==

> Structural factors, rather than individual failings

## Welfare Spending Reality

In economies like the UK, the largest portion of welfare spending is on state pensions ==for the elderly==, **not on benefits for the unemployed.**

This is why the Hong Kong government has been hesitant or "slow at developing a comprehensive government pension," possibly to avoid committing to such a large and ongoing expense.
