## The Perception vs. Reality of Wealth Inequality (Case Study: USA)

==People usually underestimate the amount of inequality found in their own societies.==

**Underestimation of Inequality**: People generally underestimate the level of inequality in their societies.

A study of over 5,000 Americans showed a significant disparity between their perception of wealth distribution, their ideal distribution, and the actual figures.

**The "Ideal" Distribution**: 92% of Americans opted for a significantly more equitable model than what they thought existed. Both Republican and Democratic voters preferred this more balanced curve. This ideal still provided incentives, with the wealthiest being 10-20 times better off than the poorest.

**The "Perceived" Distribution**: What Americans _thought_ the distribution was, while less equal than their ideal, was still far from the reality. In this perceived model, the middle class was struggling, and _the rich made about 100 times more than the poorest._

### The "Actual" Distribution

- The bottom 40% of Americans have barely any wealth
- _The top 1% holds more wealth than_ 9 out of 10 Americans believe the entire top 20% _should_ have.
	- In 2009, **the top 1% of America possessed 40% of the nation's wealth.**
- Bottom 80% of the population shared **only 7%** of the wealth between them.
- This inequality has ==worsened== over the last 20-30 years. The income share of the richest **1% nearly tripled** between 1976 and the lecture's time.
- **Average CEO** earns in one hour what an average employee earns in more than a month. The pay ratio is **380 times that of the average worker.**

## Measuring Inequality: The Gini Coefficient 吉尼係數

The Gini coefficient is a measure of income inequality that scores a society on a scale of 0 to 1.

- **0 = Perfect Equality**: Everyone has the same income.
- **1 = Perfect Inequality**: One person has all the income, and everyone else has none.

Based on the **Lorenz Diagram**.

It measures the deviation from a hypothetical line of perfect equality. For example, in a perfectly equal society, 40% of the population would earn 40% of the income.

**The area between the line of perfect equality and the actual income distribution curve is the "Area of Inequality".**

## Inequality in Hong Kong

**High Gini Coefficient**: Hong Kong's Gini coefficient has seen a ==notable increase==, particularly ==between the mid-1980s and mid-1990s.==

- Highest Gini coefficient among G8 countries, at 53.9.
- Inequality level is comparable to developing nations like Mozambique 莫三比克, Colombia, and Brazil, rather than developed economies.

### Limitations of the Gini Coefficient in the Hong Kong

**Measures Income, Not Wealth**: The Gini coefficient ==only tracks income== and fails to account for other economic assets like _property, stocks, and shares. Including these assets would likely reveal even greater inequality._

**Ignores Social Welfare**: It does not factor in economic benefits from government expenditure like _subsidized public housing, education, and healthcare_, all of which are significant in Hong Kong.

**Affected by Demographics**: A society with _a large non-working population (either very young or aging)_ will naturally show a higher Gini coefficient, which may not fully reflect the economic reality of the working population.

**Flawed Comparisons**: Comparing a dense, wealthy city like Hong Kong to an entire country (like the US) is problematic. Cities inherently tend to have _higher inequality rates than nations that include vast rural areas._
