## The "Culture of Poverty" Thesis

Poverty is a "design for living" passed down through generations.

It posits that the poor share a specific set of values and behaviors that perpetuate their own poverty.

This perspective was developed by American sociologists Oscar Lewis and David Matza based on their research in Mexico **in the 1950s.**

### Individual Level

individuals in poverty have difficulty with **"deferring gratification,"** meaning they struggle to save for the future.

Instead, they might **spend money immediately** on things like lottery tickets, gambling, or alcohol.

### Family Level

**High rates of divorce and family instability**, often attributing it to men leaving their families and having children with other women.

The term **"deadbeat dad"** emerged from this perspective in the 1980s.

### Community Level

The poor do not engage with mainstream societal institutions. For example, they may **avoid**:

- Organizing into unions to create better pay and job conditions
- Using banks
- Trusting hospitals
- Participating in formal schooling for their children.
- Not taking advantage of some of the welfare that was offered to them

## The "Situational Constraints" Thesis

This perspective offers a critique of the "culture of poverty," arguing that the behaviors observed are a _result_ of poverty, not its cause.

Poverty is the product of situational or structural barriers that limit people's opportunities.

### Shared Mainstream Values

The poor actually share the same aspirations and values as the rest of society, such as **wanting a better life for their children.**

### Rational Behavior

The behaviors of the poor are rational responses to their difficult circumstances.

For instance, people don't save money because they **have little to no disposable income to save** in the first place.

### Behavioral Change

If their circumstances were to change, the poor would change their behavior accordingly.

### Identifiable Constraints

These constraints can include factors like age, lack of skills, poor health, disability, and economic restructuring.

## Case Study: Elliot Liebow's "Tally's Corner"

Sociologist Elliot Liebow's study of "street corner men" in Washington D.C. provides strong support for the situational constraints thesis.

**Observations:** Liebow noted that the men were unemployed or underemployed in low-wage, part-time jobs. They _desired jobs with higher pay_ and status but **lacked the necessary skills and qualifications** to get them.

**Lifestyle as a Consequence:** While the men did engage in activities like drinking and gambling, Liebow interpreted this ==differently== from the "culture of poverty" theorists.

**Family Life Reinterpreted:** Men frequently left their families not out of irresponsibility, but because they ==felt like failures for being unable== to financially support them. Staying with their families was a constant reminder of this perceived failure.

**Conclusion:** Liebow concluded that ==poverty is a product of situational constraints==, and the men were ==acting rationally given their limited options.==

## Situational Constraints in Hong Kong

In the 1980s and 1990s, social workers in Hong Kong identified several structural causes of poverty:

### Economic Restructuring

Hong Kong's shift away from manufacturing to a service-based economy led to a decline in the demand for unskilled labor.

### Surplus of Low-Skilled Labor

This restructuring left a large pool of older, low-skilled workers competing for a limited number of jobs, which in turn ==drove down wages.==

### Flexible Management Strategies (Marginalization of Labor)

Companies increasingly outsourced labor 承包商 for roles like cleaning and security to contractors that compete to provide the cheapest workers. This led to:

- Short-term contracts with no long-term benefits.
- The ability for employers to cut wages and hours at the end of each contract.
- A documented **decrease in the wages of cleaners between 2001 and 2006**, prior to minimum wage legislation.
- **Stagnant or declining hourly wages for university canteen staff between 2007 and 2009**, even as the cost of living rose.
