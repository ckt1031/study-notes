## Defining Poverty: Absolute vs. Relative Measures

### Absolute Poverty

This approach defines poverty *as a matter of basic subsistence*. It asks whether an individual or household can afford fundamental necessities for survival.

Key necessities include:

- Accommodation
- Three meals a day
- Basic healthcare
- Education.

This measure was particularly ==relevant in 1950s and 1960s Hong Kong==, which was dealing with a **large influx of poor migrants from mainland China** whose primary needs were basic survival.

### Relative Poverty

> 1970s and 1980s

Poverty in comparison to the living standards of the wider society. It is not just about survival, but about *social inclusion and the ability to participate in customary societal activities.*

**Core Idea**: If lack the resources to participate in the common activities of your society (e.g., owning a mobile phone or computer when it is the norm), you are considered ==relatively poor.==

**Shift in Hong Kong**: As Hong Kong became more affluent, the definition of poverty *shifted from an absolute to a relative standard.*

**Official Measurement**: The Hong Kong Council of Social Services uses a relative measure, defining the poverty line as **half the median monthly domestic household income**.

Relative poverty highlights issues of **lifestyle and inequality**.

## Poverty, Life Expectancy, and Happiness

> Money can buy happiness up to a certain level, but after that point, increases in happiness appear to decline.

### Life Expectancy and Income in the UK

There is a clear correlation between income and life expectancy.

A map of the UK shows that wealthier areas in the ==southeast== *have higher life expectancies (well into the 80s) compared to poorer areas in the north*, like Liverpool 利物浦 and Glasgow 格拉斯哥, where life expectancy is in the 70s.

For instance, weekly household income in Kensington 肯辛頓 and Chelsea 切爾西 is £1,144 with a life expectancy of 86.6 years, *while in Glasgow 格拉斯哥 it is £388 with a life expectancy of 74 years.*

### Money and Happiness

**Within a Country (UK)**: While wealth can increase happiness up to a certain point, the correlation isn't perfect. *Some less wealthy areas in Scotland, Wales, and the South West report higher levels of happiness than wealthier parts of London.*

---

**Between Countries**: Richer countries tend to be happier, but there are exceptions.

**Hong Kong vs. Denmark**: Both have similar high standards of living and income per person.

However, on a 10-point life satisfaction scale, Denmark scores an 8 while Hong Kong scores only 5.5. This raises questions about why Danes are significantly happier.

## The State of Poverty in Hong Kong

The number of people living in poverty *has been steadily increasing.*

- In 2018, **over one in five people** lived below the poverty line.
- More recent figures from **2021** suggest this has risen to almost **a quarter of the population.**
- The number of poor people (before government intervention) rose from 1.186 million in 2001 to 1.653 million in 2020.

### Income Disparity (The Wealth Gap)

> 2024 Oxfam report revealed a huge wealth gap.

**The wealthiest 10% of households** earned a median monthly income of HK$131,000. This was **81.9 times higher than the poorest 10%**, who earned HK$1,600.

In the first quarter of 2024, the poverty line for a **one-person household was a median monthly income of HK$5,000.**

### Stagnant Wages and Purchasing Power

Real wages have only **increased by 12.3% over the last decade.**

The **purchasing power** of the minimum wage (HK$34.50) **is lower now than it was eight years ago.**

The **Big Mac Index** shows that a minimum wage worker in Hong Kong must work 36.7 minutes to buy a Big Mac, *longer than* in Canada (32.5 mins) or Japan (31 mins).

## Who Are the Poor in Hong Kong?

**Women**: They constitute the majority of the "working poor," often due to ==childcare== responsibilities, especially if they are single mothers.

**The Elderly**: This is a major and growing group. 44% of individuals over 65 are considered poor. The ==aging population== is a significant driver of increasing poverty rates. The percentage of the population aged 65 and above ==grew from about 12.5% in 2008 to 17% in 2018.==

**Children**: ==One in four== children in Hong Kong is considered poor.

**The Working Poor**: Poverty is not limited to the unemployed. About half of all poor households have at least one person working full-time. These are individuals who ==work long hours in low-paying jobs.==

### The "New Generation of Poor"

> Coined by social worker Nelson Chow

Refers to younger people, mostly under 35, who are educated but *earn low-to-middle incomes (HK$10,000–$20,000 per month).*

Often *not eligible for welfare or public housing* but may still have to pay income tax.

The **median** monthly employment earnings for those aged 25-34 is **just HK$13,600.**

#### Selectivist Approach and Less Eligibility 選擇性福利模式與「福利削減」

> Chow emphasizes that in efforts to eradicate poverty, Hong Kong should "ensure that the new income support system is one which **does not create more divisions and antagonisms**" because "Hong Kong simply could not afford to have another front where people are fighting and hating one another".

**Current Hong Kong Practice**

==**It is "obviously divisive 分裂 "**==

Hong Kong's current **Comprehensive Social Security Assistance (CSSA) scheme** operates on this principle by:

1. Assessing eligibility on **a household basis only**
2. Taking into consideration the total income and assets of the entire household
3. Turning away many who are genuinely poor and needy

For example, "poor older people cannot apply for CSSA alone as CSSA applicants living with their families are required to apply on a household basis".

The "Less Eligibility" Effect: the requirements for receiving assistance are fixed in such a way that they actually make the applicants feel they would not be eligible

接受援助的條件被設定成實際上讓申請人覺得他們不符合資格

**Universalist Approach 普遍主義取向**

> A road to universalism and social inclusion

1. Give people a sense of belonging to society
2. Offer equal opportunities for all children
3. Ensure everyone has a fair chance to share in the fruits of prosperity

**How does it work?** It's based on being a citizen or resident, not on how poor you are. A universal pension, for example, would be given to every elderly person as a right.

**The Goal/Philosophy:** To "unite people" and create social inclusion. It treats welfare as a right of citizenship, not as charity for the desperate.

**Shift:** Moving from a system that helps only the needy (selectivist) **TO** a system that helps everyone as a right (universalist).

### McRefugees (McHomeless)

> Individuals who sleep in 24-hour McDonald's restaurants.

Their numbers have **increased by 50% in three years**.

Alarmingly, nearly **40% of them** have senior high school, undergraduate, or even postgraduate qualifications.

## Pressures on the Middle Class

### Rising Costs

**Housing**: The cost of housing has dramatically increased.

**Raising Children**: Raising a child to age 22 costs about **HK$5.5 million**. Recent estimates now put this cost at **HK$6 million.** Major expenses include clothing, food, education, and housing.

### Economic Squeeze

**Job Offshoring**: Many middle-class jobs in sectors like customer service and sales have moved overseas to countries with cheaper labor.

**Weakening of Trade Unions**: The declining power of trade unions has reduced protections for wages and employee benefits.

**Rising Taxes**: The middle class also faces the pressure of rising taxes.

> The rich set the tax code to screw the middle class, the big banks charges a lot to customers etc.
