The political landscape of Hong Kong since its 1997 return to China has been defined by a series of reforms and a persistent, evolving movement for democracy.

The process can be understood through **three key stages of reform in 1997, 2012, and 2021**, battlement between *pro-democracy forces* and a powerful alliance of the Chinese government and the local business elite.

## The 1997 Post-Handover Political Structure

As laid out in the Basic Law, Hong Kong's mini-constitution, the initial post-1997 political system established a structure with limited direct democracy.

**Chief Executive Selection:**

The Chief Executive was to be selected by an 800-member Election Committee and then appointed by the *Central People's Government in Beijing*.

This committee was composed of 200 members each from four sectors:

1. Industrial/commercial/financial
2. The professions
3. Labor/social services/religious
4. Government officials/council members.

**Legislative Council (LegCo):**

Composed of 60 members.

- **30 seats** from Geographical Constituencies 地方選區, chosen through direct "one person, one vote" elections by registered voters.
- **30 seats** from Functional Constituencies, representing specific business and professional sectors.

## The Role of Functional Constituencies

Created by the British colonial government in 1985.

**Composition and Representation:**

There are ==28== functional constituencies representing various occupational groups like commerce, finance, law, education, and construction. Their purpose was to give a voice to sectors that contributed significantly to the economy.

### Democratic Deficits: 民主赤字

**Unequal Franchise 選舉權不平等:**

These constituencies have vastly different numbers of voters.

The education constituency has 88,964 voters, while the Heung Yee Kuk 鄉議局 (representing indigenous villagers) has only 155.

The entire functional constituency system, *which determined half of the government, was controlled by only 226,059 voters*, compared to 4.4 million in the geographical constituencies.

**Voting Methods**:

Some constituencies, like education, allow every member an ==individual vote==.

However, in many others, only corporations or CEOs **can cast a "body vote,"** disenfranchising ordinary workers in those sectors.

**Exclusion:**

Individuals not part of a recognized business or professional body, such as *students, retirees, or those with disabilities*, were ineligible to vote in these constituencies.

### Economic Misrepresentation

Constituencies do not reflect Hong Kong's modern economy. For example, agriculture and fisheries account for *less than 0.1% of GDP* but **hold 1 LegCo seat**.

The professions and labor, contributing *over half of the economic output*, **had only 3 seats**.

## The 2012 Reforms: A Step Toward Openness

In response to growing pressure from the democracy movement, a set of reforms were introduced in 2012 that appeared to expand political participation.

**Chief Executive Election Committee:** Expanded from 800 to ==1,200== members.  
**Legislative Council (LegCo):** Expanded from 60 to 70 seats.

- Geographical constituency seats increased from 30 to 35.
- Functional constituency seats remained at 30.
- **5 new "super seats"** were created for voters not eligible to vote in any other functional constituency.

## The 2021 Reforms: A Reduction of Democratic Influence

The 2021 reforms were a direct response by **Beijing to the 2019 anti-extradition bill protests** and the subsequent **success of pro-democracy candidates** in district council elections.

Reversed the trend towards democratization and greatly *reduced the influence* of directly elected members.

---

**Legislative Council (LegCo):** The LegCo *was expanded to 90 seats*, but the composition was radically altered:

- **20 seats** from Geographical Constituencies (a sharp decrease from 35).
- **30 seats** from Functional Constituencies.
- **40 seats** appointed by a revamped Election Committee.

As a result, the proportion of directly elected members fell from 50% in 1997 to approximately **22.2%**.

---

**Revamped Election Committee**

The committee was expanded to ==1,500 members==.

Crucially, the 117 seats formerly held by directly *elected district councilors* (who were mostly pro-democracy after 2019) ==were eliminated==.

They were replaced by members of government-appointed bodies like fire safety and crime prevention committees.

Consequently, over 2/3 of the new committee's members **are appointed by authorities or selected by pro-establishment groups.**

---

**Candidate Screening**

A ==new vetting mechanism== was introduced.

The National Security Unit of the Hong Kong Police now *conducts background checks* on all candidates for the legislature, Election Committee, and Chief Executive to ensure they are **"patriotic"**.
