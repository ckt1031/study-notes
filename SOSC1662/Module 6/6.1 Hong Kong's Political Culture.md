> Definition of **"minimally integrated political system"**  
> Hong Kong people were seen to be relatively disinterested in politics and had low voter turnouts compared to other countries and regions

Hong Kong society was often described as "apolitical," characterized by a "minimally integrated political system" up until the *1990s*.

This observation is supported by comparing Hong Kong's low voter turnout in the 2021 Legislative Council election (30.20%) to that of G8 nations and other East Asian countries.

However, turnout has fluctuated significantly, peaking at 58.28% in 2016 before a sharp decline. Two main sets of theories emerged to explain this perceived **political apathy.**

## Theories Focusing on Society and Culture

### Utilitarian Familism

> Proposed by sociologist **Lau Siu Kai 功利家庭主義**

- Hong Kong's Chinese residents prioritize the family's interests above those of society.  
- Avoid external associations like political organizations or trade unions
- They are in isolated family groups with nothing to hold together.

### Michael Bond's 'The Tao of Stability' 《穩定之路》

1. Traditional Chinese proverbs that value peace over conflict.
	- "It is better to be a dog in times of peace, than a man in times of conflict"
	- 寧為和犬，勿為亂人
2. Hong Kong people believe their success is a product of their own effort.
3. Do not look to the government for help
4. Accept colonial rule and maintain stability.

## Theories Focusing on Governmental Legitimacy

### Ian Scott's Crisis-Response Model

Colonial government skillfully *achieved legitimacy* by effectively responding to a series of social crises, reducing the population's desire for political involvement.

**Crisis 1 (1884-1950)**:

To quell protests from traders over taxation and spending, the government co-opted major merchant companies by including them in the ==Legislative Council (LegCo)==.

**Crisis 2 (1950s-1970s)**:

Widespread government corruption (e.g., the Peter Godber scandal 葛柏醜聞) and social turmoil, including the **1967 riots**, threatened British rule.

The government responded with major reforms:

1. Establishing the *Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC)* in 1974.
2. Making **Chinese** an official language.
3. Expanding the **public housing scheme**.
4. Providing **free compulsory secondary education**.

**Crisis 3 (1980-1997)**:

To address the rising middle class's concerns about *democracy and quality of life*, the government introduced limited democratic channels, such as District Board elections 區議會選舉 and functional constituencies for professional and business associations 專業和商業協會的功能組別.

***A Counter-Narrative of Conflict:***

The notion of an *apolitical society* is directly challenged.

Timeline of campaigns, from the 1935 campaign to *change marriage laws* to the *1966 Star Ferry Riots* and numerous *labor disputes*, demonstrating a long tradition of political activism.
