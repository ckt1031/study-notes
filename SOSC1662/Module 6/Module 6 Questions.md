The Basic Law seems to promise universal suffrage. Why has it been such a point of contention?

1. "Gradual and Orderly Progress"
2. The Nominating Committee
3. **High Bar for Amendments:** Changing these election methods requires a two-thirds majority in the LegCo, the Chief Executive's consent, and approval from Beijing's National People's Congress Standing Committee, ==making any reform that Beijing opposes virtually impossible to pass.==

<span style="font-size: 20"><strong>What was the role of China in Hong Kong's political development?</strong></span>

**The Role of China:**

- (1) HK depended heavily on food and water from the mainland, the Chinese government is identified as the most crucial actor determining Hong Kong's political development.
- (3) After the civil war had ended, however, the Communists, who had emerged as the winner on the mainland, **began to assert control over the British colony.**
- British administration initially considered democratization after World War II, these plans were abandoned in 1952 due to opposition from the Chinese Communist government.
- **Colonial Co-optation:** The colonial government relied on coopting business leaders to ==secure its legitimacy.==

**Alliance:**

- (2) China formed an "unholy alliance" with the business sector to *ensure stability and avert democratization*.
- The business elite staunchly opposes representative democracy 代議制民主, fearing it would empower the poor and lead to **greater social redistribution.**

> This has entrenched a system that favors business interests, leading to Hong Kong being ranked number one in *The Economist's* 2014 crony-capitalism index 裙帶資本主義指數.

**Post-Handover Control:**

- Since the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration 《中英聯合聲明》, China has worried that *genuine democracy in Hong Kong could threaten its one-party rule* and reduce its control.
- The Basic Law's clause allowing for **"gradual and orderly progress" 循序漸進** has been used to ==delay universal suffrage==, without a firm timetable, which authorities have used to delay reforms.
- (4) The 2014 White Paper asserted Beijing's **"comprehensive jurisdiction"** over the city, clarifying the limits of its autonomy.

<span style="font-size: 20"><strong>What, according to historical records, would have happened if the colonial government had allowed Hong Kong to have popular representation in the past?</strong></span>

If the colonial government had *allowed popular representation*, the Chinese would have threatened to take back the city ==by force== because this would have been seen as a step toward **self-governance**.

<span style="font-size: 20"><strong>What has been the role and concerns of the business sector in Hong Kong's political development?</strong></span>

Roles:

Hong Kong's fast economic growth increased the gap between rich and poor. The business elite gained more power. A "hands-off" government policy made sure they supported the unelected government.

- The private sector held the most power. This included owners of *major banks, industries, businesses, and property*. Leaders of public industries and important professionals also had some power.
- Hong Kong's political growth showed this close link. Key private sector members were always given important political roles.
- **More than half** of the Basic Law Consultative Committee members came from business and professional fields.
- Before the handover, **the Chinese government worked closely with businesses and key professional groups**. This was part of their effort to unite different groups. They saw these groups as the "traditional pillars of Hong Kong society." **They believed these groups could help keep peace after the handover.**
- To lessen opposition to the business sector's strong role, **professional groups were given government positions**. This brought them into the system.

Concerns:

- Greater representative politics could lead to more substantial social redistribution.
- The business sector was deeply worried about their future following the 1984 Sino-British Declaration
- While the tycoons kept a low profile during the Umbrella Movement, key executives went to Beijing to discuss the occupation of the streets, which they feared could have significant influence on business confidence.
- They were also deeply worried that **any form of resolution could mean the possible expansion of social redistribution, more powerful unions, and more business regulation.**
- Hence the **business sector has become staunchly opposed to any form of democratization** that would empower the majority of the population.

> As a former Chief Executive stated, giving the vote to everyone might empower the half of Hong Kong's population earning less than US$1,800 a month, which from the business perspective, would harm the economy.

- In the growing democracy movement of the 1980s, politically active students joined other civil society groups to press for democratization.
- In 1984, the year the Sino-British Joint Declaration was signed, the Hong Kong Federation of Students (HKFS), for instance, made it clear that it favored direct elections.
- Similarly, student organizations backed the early pro-democracy activists during the Basic Law drafting process.
- Finally, students were also active in the organization of protests in 1989 to support fellow student activists in Beijing and other cities across China. The activists also joined other important social movements after the handover.
- This was evident in mass protests such as the 1 July protests which attracted large number of young people. Even though the student organizations actively participated in these movements, *they were no longer the driving force*.

**Movement to protect Choi Yuen Village (2009-2010):**

Young activists protested the village's demolition *for an express rail link project*, highlighting growing anti-capitalist sentiment and dissent against business interests.

**Movement against Moral and National Education (2011-2012)**

![[6.4 The democracy movement after 1997#^7d2aa8]]

Together with parents and other civil society groups, they eventually joined the Civil Alliance Against the National Education, which mobilized tens of thousands of protesters for a march on 29 July 2012.

On the following day, Scholarism then started **an occupation campaign of the government offices in Admiralty.**

Students and other activists also organized a **hunger strike.**

**Universal suffrage**

In 2014, The Hong Kong Federation of Students (HKFS) played a key role in developing alternative proposals over how **universal suffrage should be implemented**. Both secondary and university students jointly called for a boycott of classes starting on 22 September.

Students gave an ultimatum to the Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying to meet them and discuss universal suffrage by Thursday 25 September.  

*On October 21*, a 90-minute televised dialogue took place. Five student leaders and five government officials participated. This dialogue showed the big differences between both sides. ==However, it did not lead to any real changes.==

Student leaders then wanted to send three students to Beijing. This delegation aimed to negotiate directly with the Chinese government. But their plan failed. ==On November 15, they were denied permission to board a plane.==
