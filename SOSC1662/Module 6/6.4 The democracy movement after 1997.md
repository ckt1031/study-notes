## Historical Context and Early Developments

British administration initially considered democratization after World War II, these plans were abandoned in 1952 due to opposition from the Chinese Communist government.

For a long time, the colonial government maintained stability and legitimacy ==through economic success==, which created significant social mobility and the famed **"Lion Rock spirit"** of achieving success through hard work.

Pro-democracy activists formed coalitions like the Joint Committee on the Promotion of Democratic Government (JCPDG) 民主政府促進聯合委員會 to advocate for greater representation.

## Post-1997: Protests, Divisions, and the Rise of New Actors

After the 1997 handover, there *was a brief period of reconciliation*, with the Democratic Party adopting a more moderate stance.

**1997 Asian Financial Crisis** shifted public focus to economic issues, and pro-Beijing parties like the DAB gained support by addressing everyday concerns.

**Government attempt to introduce an anti-subversion law under Article 23 of the Basic Law in 2003.**

Sparked a massive protest of 500,000 people, the largest since 1989.

- Leading to the law's suspension
- Eventual resignation of Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa.
- ==The annual 1 July protests became a regular feature, invigorating the democracy movement.==

**The pan-democratic camp became increasingly fragmented.**

In 2010, the Democratic Party compromised with Beijing on a reform package, a move opposed by more radical groups.

**Student movements re-emerged as a central force in the 2010s.**

In 2012, secondary school students led the successful movement against the proposed Moral and National Education curriculum, which was seen as a form of "brain-washing". ^7d2aa8

This movement gave rise to the student group **Scholarism** 「學民思潮」and demonstrated the growing strength of a distinct Hong Kong identity, particularly among the youth.

### The Umbrella Movement (2014)

The Umbrella Movement of 2014 was a **direct response to Beijing's restrictive framework for the 2017 Chief Executive election.**

The proposal allowed for "one person, one vote" but required candidates to be pre-screened by ==a nominating committee dominated by Beijing loyalists.==

- Spearheaded by students who, dissatisfied with the government's response to their demands, initiated a class boycott and later attempted to occupy Civic Square.
- The police's use of *pepper spray* and tear gas against peaceful protesters, who used umbrellas for defense, gave the movement its name and triggered a massive public backlash, with **hundreds of thousands occupying major roads.**

While the 79-day occupation ultimately did not achieve its goal of "genuine universal suffrage," It also reinforced the declining **influence of traditional democratic parties**, who only joined the protest sites later.

### The Aftermath and Recent Developments

New political groups formed by students, such as Demosistō 香港眾志 and Youngspiration 青年新政, emerged, advocating for greater self-determination and autonomy.

"Localist" groups also gained traction, protesting the **influx of mainland Chinese residents** and what they saw as **an erosion of Hong Kong's unique culture.**

#### The 2019 Anti-extradition Bill Protests

Millions of people joined. Protests were characterized as **leaderless, self-mobilized, and technologically enabled**, with a strong sense of ==solidarity among different factions of the pan-democratic camp.==

The subsequent crackdown has been severe. Many key activists have been arrested, student groups have been disbanded, and numerous civil society organizations, including the influential Democratic Party, have been forced to dissolve due to political pressure and lack of funding.

Recent elections have seen **non-establishment candidates marginalized, holding only a tiny fraction of seats in LegCo.**

Surveys now indicate a ==significant decline in political interest among Hong Kongers==, raising questions about the future of political engagement in the city.
