## The "Invention" of Childhood

The modern understanding of "childhood" as a **distinct and protected phase of life** is a relatively recent social construction, *not a historical constant*.

---

French historian Philippe Ariès argued that the **concept of childhood was non-existent in medieval society.**

Historically, children were often *viewed as miniature adults*. They wore adult-style clothing, were subject to the same laws, and could face *severe punishments like imprisonment or execution*.

### Labor and Warfare

Throughout history and even in *some contemporary societies*, **children have been integrated into adult roles**, such as labor and warfare.

- **Children worked in factories** during the early Industrial Revolution *before the introduction of child labor laws.*
- In countries like Myanmar and Syria, **children are conscripted as soldiers.**
- **Boys** as young as **12 or 13 were recruited into the British Army** during World War I.

## The Shift to Modern Childhood

The **20th century saw a significant shift** in how childhood was perceived, driven by ==economic and social changes.==

### Economic Changes

With declining agriculture and increased mechanization, **children's economic importance in production diminished.**

Consequently, **child-rearing became more expensive**, and families began having fewer children.

### Emotional Investment

As ==child mortality rates fell==, parents began to invest ==more emotionally and financially== in their fewer children.

Leading to the development of specialized clothes, games, and activities **specifically for them.**

## Case Study: The Development of Playgrounds in Hong Kong

> The multi-purpose Southorn Playground was described in the 1947 novel *The Story of Shrimp Ball* as a "microcosm of Hong Kong society," filled with people from all walks of life.

> Play has been used as a tactic in social justice movements, such as the use of "Lennon Walls" and the game `Pokémon GO` by protestors to evade police during the 2019 anti-extradition protests.

> 抗議者聲稱他們是聚集在一起玩 Pokémon GO 的遊戲玩家，目的是**規避警方拒絕集會許可**

### Child Labor and Its Consequences

In 1921, a Hong Kong commission reported that children as young as seven were working long hours.

The subsequent Employment and Children's Ordinance of **1922** *restricted child labor* but led to an ==unintended increase in "street children".==

### The First Playgrounds

Playgrounds were "invented" as **safe, supervised spaces to cultivate good moral conduct**.

The first urban playgrounds appeared in the 1920s as a British colonial project to ==improve child welfare and the image of colonial rule.==

These early playgrounds were multi-purpose, used not only by children but also by adults for activities like sports, markets, and martial arts practice.

### Post-War and Cold War Developments

> The government was initially hesitant to build housing and playgrounds for *the influx of migrants* after WWII, fearing that welfare measures might cause the city to "**slide into socialism"**.
>
> It was only after the devastating Shek Kip Mei fire in 1953 that the administration was forced to address the housing crisis.

After World War II, a population boom led to the **construction of resettlement estates** with basic, utilitarian playgrounds.

During the Cold War, playground design was influenced by Western ideals of creative ***expression as a marker of democratic freedom, in contrast to communist repression.***

This led to the emergence of abstract, artist-designed playgrounds like the Shek Lei Playground (1969), intended to stimulate the minds of a youthful population and reinforce Hong Kong's image as a modern city.

> The 1960s abstract playgrounds (like Shek Lei) were developed against a backdrop of the 1966-67 riots.  
>
> > 1960 年代的抽象遊樂場（如石籬）是在 1966-67 年騷亂的背景下發展起來的 。
>
> The British administration hurriedly organized youth programs and built playgrounds specifically to placate a youthful population that was seen as susceptible to Communist influence from the Cultural Revolution happening nearby.  
>
> > 英國政府匆忙組織青年計劃，並建造遊樂場，特別是為了安撫被認為容易受到附近發生的文化大革命的共產主義影響的年輕人口 。

### The Rise of Safety and Commercialization

By the late 1970s and 80s, a global shift towards risk aversion led to the *replacement of unique, abstract designs with standardized, mass-produced plastic equipment* that complied with **international safety standards**.

In the new millennium, play spaces have increasingly **moved indoors into commercial complexes** like shopping malls, reflecting both the city's high-density development and the commodification of play.

> Likely influenced by local factors, such as the *rise of foreign domestic helpers* supervising children in playgrounds *as more mothers entered the workforce.*

## The Emergence of Youth

"Youth" or "adolescence" as a prolonged stage between childhood and adulthood is also a modern phenomenon, **shaped by social and educational changes.**

### Youth Subcultures 青年次文化

Following World War II, with *young people no longer required for military service*, they began to forge their own distinct identities separate from the adult world.

**Western Subcultures**: Distinctive youth subcultures emerged, characterized by unique fashions, styles, and music:

- "Teddy Boys" in the 1950s
- "Punk rockers" in the 1970s.

**Hong Kong Subcultures**: Similar trends appeared in Hong Kong, with youth developing their:

- Own modes of **transport** (skateboards), clothing, and language.
- **Music**, particularly K-pop, has been a significant anchor for many Asian youth subcultures.

## Prolonged Youth and Delayed Adulthood

The *expansion of education* has significantly extended the period of youth.

### Education

The expansion of higher education means *many young people do not enter the workforce* until *after completing* undergraduate or even postgraduate degrees, sometimes into their thirties.

### Characteristics of Modern Youth

**Delaying traditional markers of adulthood**, such as getting married, leaving home, and achieving financial independence.

Instead, **they spend significant time in education, sports, or other developmental activities.**

### Political and Social Engagement

Associated flexible time, has enabled them to become **deeply involved in politics, environmentalism, and social welfare issues**.

This has led to the identification of distinct "youth generations" like the "millennial," "post-80s," and "post-90s" generations, whose **opinions are often seen as authentic and influential**.

> Joshua Wong 黃之鋒, who became the face of the student-led Scholarism movement, is a prominent example of this youth activism.

## The Two Sides of Youth in Hong Kong

While educated, politically active youth are highly visible, **there is another segment of young people who face significant challenges.**

### "Problem Youth"

**Economic Dislocation**: The ==decline of manufacturing jobs== in Hong Kong has made the school-to-work transition difficult for young people who leave school with **few qualifications.**

**Labels and Stigmas**: These marginalized young people are often labeled as "hidden youth," "NEET" (Not in Education, Employment, or Training), or "non-engaged youth".

> They are frequently associated with societal problems like drug abuse, triad 黑社會 involvement, and dropping out of school.

### Systemic Failures

Core problem within Hong Kong's highly competitive education system:

- Primarily rewards academic achievement  
- Offers few pathways for those who do not excel in that environment.  

Young people from **lower-income families** find it particularly ==difficult to survive==, let alone thrive.
