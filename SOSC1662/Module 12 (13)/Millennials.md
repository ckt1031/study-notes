## Contrasting Millennial Experiences

A stark contrast within the generation.

On one hand, there is the Christian rock band RF2, promoting **sexual purity and moral values**.

On the other, there is a **general openness to sex**, fueled by the widespread availability of internet ==pornography==, which is a key concern for youth workers.

This tension between religion / tradition and modern sexuality is a key theme.

## Economic Insecurity for Millennials

The generation feels insecure about its future. Career paths are less certain than for previous generations, who had stable factory work.

They face competition for jobs from mainlanders who may accept lower pay.

## Extra Hurdles for Ethnic Minorities

The story of Jan, a Filipino millennial, shows the "extra hurdles" faced by ethnic minorities, including language barriers and a "vicious cycle" of having to take out loans and work to pay for their own education **without family financial support.**
