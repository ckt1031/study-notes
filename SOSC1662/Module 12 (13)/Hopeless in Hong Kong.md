While women report difficulty finding a partner, census data shows there are **actually 20,000 more single men than women** in the same age bracket in Hong Kong.

## Quality Men

Hong Kong women are not just looking for a provider.

They seek =="quality men"== who:

- Caring
- Communicative
- Emotionally ready
- Self-worth

They criticize men for being "kids in their mentalities" and **spending too much time on video games**, suggesting these men fail to ==meet modern expectations for an intimate partner.==

## Challenges for Successful Women

Men tend to "marry down", preferring partners **who are younger, less accomplished, and less educated than they are.**

Significant challenge for *highly educated and successful women.*  
One woman interviewed even admitted she doesn't dare tell men how much she earns for fear of scaring them away.

## Competition in the "Mating Market"

Hong Kong women perceive intense competition from several groups:

- *Mainland Chinese and **overseas** Chinese women.*
- The most "formidable competitor" of all is ==younger women==. This connects to the idea that women are seen as having an "expiration date" after they pass their 20s or 30s.

## Settling for "Mr. Goodenough"

The lecture concludes with the idea from marriage counselor Lori Gottlieb:

Due to *complexities of modern expectations*, people should perhaps **stop searching for a perfect partner** and instead "settle for mister Goodenough".
