The abstract, artist-designed playgrounds of the 1960s and 70s reflected Cold War ideals of democratic freedom versus communist repression.

## Question 5

How have free public playgrounds in contemporary Hong Kong become "contested spaces," and what does their use reveal about the city's social fabric, including class, ethnicity, and generational divides, according to "Space for Play"?

---

Are not just for children but are **complex social arenas where different societal groups interact**, coexist, and sometimes conflict. Their use reveals the city's social fabric through a "temporal rhythm":

**Afternoons (Migrant Domestic Workers):** Playgrounds are used by Filipina and Indonesian domestic workers who bring their employers' children to play, using the ==time to socialize and share information with each other.==

**Evenings (The Elderly):** Older generations assemble in the evenings for activities like Tai Chi, dancing, and to use low-intensity exercise equipment designed for the city's aging population.

**Late Nights (Teenagers):** The spaces are a hub for teenagers to engage in activities like drinking and socializing, but this can also _involve illicit activities like drug dealing,_ which in turn attracts state surveillance.

**Sundays (A "Takeover"):** On their day off, playgrounds and parks are often entirely =="overtaken by armies of domestic workers"== who use the public space for rest and community building.

**Ethnic Marginalization:** The space is also contested because its design often excludes certain groups. For example, Pakistani children struggle to find places to play cricket üèè, _as this form of play is not legitimized_ in the official design of these spaces.
