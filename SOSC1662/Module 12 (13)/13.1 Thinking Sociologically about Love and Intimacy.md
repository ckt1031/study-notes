## The Social Constraints on "Personal" Choice

While love feels *subjective and emotional*, a sociological analysis reveals that our choices in partners are not as free as we might think. They are heavily **restricted by social and demographic** factors.

### The "Marriage Market" Exercise

Asking students if they would marry someone based on criteria like age, income, language, education, and religion.

**Age**: Many would not marry someone over 45, yet this excludes over 50% of the Hong Kong population.

**Income**: A preference against marrying someone earning less than HKD $6,000 per month excludes 7.2% of the population.

**Education**: A desire for a partner with a university education eliminates over 65% of the potential pool.

**Religion**: Wanting to marry a Christian is highly restrictive, *as nearly 84%* of the Hong Kong population is not Christian.

### Demographic Realities

After accounting for those already married (51.19%) and those too young (12.2%), the available pool of partners is *significantly smaller than it initially appears*.

This shows that **societal structure, not just personal preference**, dictates our romantic possibilities.

### Predictable Patterns

People tend to **marry within predictable age ranges (mid to late 20s)**, which suggests that ==social norms==, rather than random chance, guide this life event.

## The Romantic Love Ideal: A Modern Social Construct

The modern emphasis on **love as the primary basis for marriage** is a relatively recent development, which sociologists term the "romantic love ideal."

**Love as the Only Basis for Marriage**: The belief that financial and practical considerations are *secondary to emotional connection*. This is captured in phrases like "love conquers all" and "love is blind."

**The "One True Love"**: The idea that there is *a single, destined person for each of us*.

### Love as a Social Construction

We learn what love is and how to experience it from our culture, through movies, music, books, and social media.

It is not an innate, **universal experience but one that is shaped by the society we live in.**

### Gender and Romance

Counterintuitively, studies show that **MEN are often more romantic** than women.

Men are *more likely to believe in "love at first sight,"* the existence of "one true love," and that love should be the sole basis for marriage.

Women have historically ==been more concerned with the practicalities of marriage==, such as financial security for raising children.

> Women often bear a greater responsibility for managing the household and raising children.  
> More pragmatic when choosing a partner, weighing factors like income, stability, and reliability more heavily.

## The Changing Functions of the Family and Marriage

The reason romantic love has become so central to marriage is due to *fundamental shifts in the function of the family over the last two centuries.*

### Pre-Industrialization (Before the 19th Century)

The family was a **"unit of production."**  
Men, women, and children worked together on family farms.

Marriages were primarily arranged for **economic or political purposes.**

The object of **romantic** love was frequently portrayed as *unobtainable or unavailable* (e.g., from a rival family or social class), separating it from the practical institution of marriage.

Large families were an economic asset, ==providing necessary labor.==

### Post-Industrialization (19th-20th Century)

The industrial economy replaced the family farm, and work moved outside the home.

The *state took over traditional family functions* like education, pensions, and healthcare (the "welfare state").

==Children== transformed from a financial asset into an **"economic burden"** due to the costs of education, clothing, and leisure.

This led to smaller family sizes and the rise of the **nuclear family**.

> ***Nuclear family***: a family group consisting of parents and their children (one or more), typically living in one home residence. (they live together)

## New Expectations for Modern Marriage

As the family's economic function diminished and *women gained financial independence*, the purpose of marriage shifted.

**Marriage is no longer simply a financial transaction**. Partners are now expected to provide:

- Friendship
- Romance and intimacy
- Sexual satisfaction
- Intellectual stimulation
