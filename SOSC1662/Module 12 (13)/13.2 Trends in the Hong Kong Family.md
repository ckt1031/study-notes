## Marriage Trends

### Delayed Marriage

The average age of first marriage is now around **31 for men** and **30 for women**.

This is a significant shift from the 1980s when many women planned to *marry shortly after university.*

Women today ==prioritize careers and further education== more than in the past.

### Delayed Childbirth

Women are having their first child later, **at an average age of 31.**

The median age at first childbirth **rose** from 26.6 in 1986 to 31.6 in 2017.

This contributes to ==smaller family sizes== as the window for having multiple children is shorter.

### Increase in Singles

There is a **growing trend of people not marrying at all.**  
The percentage of never-married individuals has **increased significantly since the 1980s.**

==Women face greater social pressure== for remaining single, with terms like "Leftover Women" (from China) and " 剩女 " (in Hong Kong) being used to criticize them.

### Marriage Remains an Ideal

- Despite delays and rising divorce rates, **marriage is still a popular institution.**
- Dating apps and TV shows indicate a continued search for relationships.
- ==First-time marriages== actually **saw a steady increase between 2000 and 2012.**

## Divorce and Remarriage

### Rising Divorce Rates

The divorce rate **has increased fivefold since the 1980s**.

While *lower than in the US and UK*, Hong Kong's divorce rate ==is higher than in many neighboring Asian countries.==

### Factors Influencing Divorce

#### Socioeconomic Status

==Lower income== is strongly correlated with ==higher divorce rates==. An annual income over US$50,000 can reduce the chance of divorce by 30%.

#### Cross-Border Marriages

In 2006, 35% of marrying Hong Kong men wed **mainland** women. These marriages often face challenges like crowded living conditions and domestic violence.

#### Age at Marriage

==Marrying at age 25 or older reduces the risk== of divorce by 24% compared to marrying under 18

#### Timing of Childbirth

Having a baby 7 months or more *after* marriage **decreases** the divorce risk by 24%.

#### Other Factors

Having some college education, religious affiliation, and parents who are not divorced can further **decrease the risk of divorce**.

### Length of Marriage

The *average* length of a marriage for *divorcing* couples is **11.5 to 12.7 years.**

This is ==highly dependent== on children:

- **No children**: 7 years.
- **1-2 children**: 14.3 years.
- **3+ children**: 22.2 years.

### Remarriage

Rates of remarriage have **increased sharply since 2000.**

The number of cases *involving two or more remarriages* for one or both partners has **also grown substantially.**

This suggests people ==still value marriage== and are determined to "get it right".

> Examples: Larry King (8 times), Elizabeth Taylor (9 times), and journalist Linda Wolfe (26 times).

## Family Structure and Demographics

### Evolution of Family Type (F.M. Wong's 3 Phases)

**Temporary, Broken Family (until 1940s)**: Men came to Hong Kong to work, *leaving families on the mainland.*

> Temporarily to take advantage of the new industrializing economy intending to return

**Settled Stem/Extended Family (post-WWII)**: Men *brought their families to Hong Kong*, often living with extended relatives.

**Nuclear Family (since 1960s)**: Consists of *two parents living with their young children.*

### Declining Family Size

There has been a **marked decline in fertility and family size**.

In 1961, **30%** of households *had six or more* people.

Since then, *one and two-person households have dramatically increased*. The average domestic household size **fell from 4.4 in 1961 to 2.8 in 2016.**

### Single-Parent Families

The **rise in divorce** has led to a **growth in single-parent households.**

These are ==overwhelmingly headed by women==, who are typically given responsibility for childcare.

### Aging Population

This is a major societal concern.

It is projected that in 20 years, *nearly a quarter of the population will be over 65*, raising questions about how a smaller working population can support a larger elderly one.

## Challenging Myths and Anxieties

### Myth of the "Leftover Woman"

The anxiety that older, single women cannot find a partner is widespread.

A notorious *Newsweek* article claimed a single woman in her 40s had **a better chance of being killed by a terrorist than marrying.**

**Reality**: This is ==false==.

While the chance of a woman reaching 40 without ever marrying has increased, the chance that a woman who postpones marriage will *eventually* marry has also **risen substantially**. First-time marriages for women aged **35-39 have increased almost 40% in the last 12 years.**

### Myth of Less Time with Children

It's *often* claimed parents today *spend 40% less time* with their children than in 1965.

**Reality**: Sociologist Stephanie Coontz argues this is untrue.

Parents now spend **the same, if not more**, time with their children. This is possible because families are smaller, ==fewer children allow parents to devote more time to each one.==

### "Happier" Marriages Than Those in the past

While modern marriages *are more likely to end in divorce*, the ones that *do* last are described by the participants as happier and for longer periods than in the past.

Historical marriages were often forms of **coercion**, arranged for economic and political reasons where happiness was not a primary expectation.

Today, people marry for love and companionship, and they have the freedom to leave an unhappy union, meaning those who **stay together are more likely to be in genuinely fulfilling partnerships.**
