Diffuse religions are defined as beliefs and practices that are *deeply integrated into everyday life* and *do not require a formal organization, institution, or specific place of worship.*

**Ghost stories** popular among university students, for example, *are shown to reflect the tension between academic pressures and romantic relationships.*

## Religion in Urbanizing Kwun Tong (1980s)

> **Objective**: To understand what happens to *traditional Chinese religions* when people move into modern urban areas.

**Key Findings on Specific Practices**:

### Ancestor Worship

The deceased continue to exist in an afterlife and have material needs. Worshippers burn paper replicas of money, houses, and modern items like phones to appease them.

- **Shift from Rural to Urban:** The practice moved from public, community-wide rituals in **village ancestral halls (祠堂)** to private ceremonies within **individual homes** for the immediate family.
- **Generational Decline:** Myers found that rituals were mostly performed by *grandmothers*, with **only half the children** joining in. A 2010 study confirms this trend, showing that while daily practice is low (18%), it remains high during major festivals like Ching Ming (80%).

### Worship of Deities

**Prevalence in 1980s:** The **Earth God (土地公)** was found in 60% of households, and the **Kitchen God (灶君)** in 44%.

**Generational Decline:** Myers found that **only 24.2% of children** took part in worshipping these deities.

#### The Kitchen God (灶君)

> Keep watch over the family unit

He acts as a celestial watchdog 天上的看門狗, recording a family's deeds and reporting them annually to the Jade Emperor 玉皇大帝, which results in rewards or punishments.

**Moral Teaching:** The deity serves as a higher power to regulate **gluttony 暴食**, promoting the Chinese value of frugality 節儉.

**Symbolism:** In illustrations, he is depicted as a *central authority* over a noble family, signifying that the moral teaching was especially relevant to the rich who could afford excess.

### Temples and Cults

**Function in Urban Areas:** Instead of uniting the whole community, temples like Wong Tai Sin were found to be dominated by **non-Cantonese speaking minority groups** (e.g., Chiu Chow 潮州人, Hoklo 福佬人).

They served the needs of a *specific sub-community* rather than the general population.

## From "Pervasive" to "Restricted"

> Argument: The process of urbanization in Hong Kong transformed *traditional religions* from a pervasive, public force into **a restricted, private practice.**

**Pervasive Religion:** A belief system that is *for everyone* and serves to unite the entire community.

**Restricted Religion:** A belief system whose social function has narrowed to serve only the private **nuclear family** or a specific, *smaller group* within the larger community.
