## The Sociological Approach to Religion

**Non-Sociological Questions:** Common questions like "Does God exist?" or "Is a particular religion true?" are not the focus of sociology.

**Sociological Question:** A sociological approach asks, "What do people actually do when they practice religion?" It focuses on the observable social functions and structures of religion.

## Emile Durkheim's Definition of Religion

> Emile Durkheim (1858-1917) was a key figure in the sociology of religion.

A unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things that is to say, things set apart and forbidden-beliefs and practices which unite in one simple moral community called a church, all those who adhere to it.

一套關於神聖事物的統一信仰和實踐體系，也就是那些被劃分開來並被禁止的事物，這些信仰和實踐將所有信奉者團結在一個被稱為「教會」的簡單道德共同體中。

### The Sacred and the Profane

- All religious behavior involves separating the **sacred** from the **profane**.
- **Sacred (神聖):** Refers to things that are *set apart, special, and sometimes forbidden.*
- **Profane (平凡):** Refers to everyday, non-sacred things.

Examples:

**Objects:** A sacred book (Bible 《聖經》, Koran《古蘭經》) vs. a profane, everyday book.  
**Places:** A sacred temple or church vs. an ordinary building.  
**Times:** Sacred holidays vs. ordinary work days.  
**Food**: Certain foods may be forbidden or reserved for special occasions.

### A Community of Worshippers

Religion requires a "community of worshippers with *a strong sense of belonging*." This community is what Durkheim calls a "church."

Practicing a religion creates a feeling of *solidarity and similarity* with other members.

This is different from other supernatural practices, like visiting a fortune teller, **which does not create a lasting community bond.**

Importantly, in Durkheim's sociological definition, ==a religion does not necessarily require a god.==

### The Origin of Religion: Totemism (圖騰信仰)

> Durkheim studied what he considered a simple form of religion, Totemism, to understand the origins of all religion.

#### The Process of Totemism

1. A clan (部落) chooses a totem (an animal, plant, or object).
2. Crucially, the clan chooses a totem that **resembles its own perceived characteristics 類似於其自身可察覺的特徵**. (e.g., a clever clan chooses a fox; a fast clan chooses a bird).
3. The clan names itself after the totem and tries to be like it, sometimes dressing as the totem in festivals.

#### Durkheim's Conclusion

- The origin of the totem is the clan itself.
- Therefore, **the origin of all religion is society itself**.
- When the clan worships the totem, **it is actually worshipping a representation of itself**.

**Function:** This act of collective worship creates a =="tremendous amount of social solidarity"== among members.

#### Modern Examples of Totemism

**Nationalism 民族主義:** Citizens celebrating US national holidays like the 4th of July, dressing in the flag's colors, and feeling a sense of unity.

**Cultural Festivals:** The Dragon Dance during Chinese New Year.

**Sporting Events:** Fans dressing in team colors, identifying strongly with their team, and feeling solidarity with other fans.

### Collective Effervescence

This is a state of *high emotional energy and unity* experienced by a group of people during a ritual or ceremony. It strengthens social bonds and the sense of belonging.

### The Evolution of Religion and Society

Durkheim's theory proposes that if religion reflects society, *then as society changes, its religion must also change.*

| Type of Society                                          | Social Structure                                                                                                                                                           | Form of Religion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Hunting & Gathering Societies 狩獵採集社會** (until 7000 BC) | Egalitarian 平等主義, with few material possessions and little hierarchy.                                                                                                      | **Egalitarian Religion:** A belief in many different gods (of the sun, sea, sky) that were all considered relatively equal.                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Horticultural Societies 園藝社會** (7000-3000 BC)          | Basic farming, where large families and many children were necessary for labor.                                                                                            | **Fertility-focused Religion:** Totems and religious practices often centered on themes of fertility, women, and large families, such as *ancestor worship.*                                                                                                                   |
| **Agrarian Societies 農業社會** (3000 BC - 1800 AD)          | Advanced farming created more wealth and a strong social hierarchy: *a powerful king at the top*, followed by an aristocracy, and a large class of peasants at the bottom. | **Hierarchical & Universalistic Religions 等級制和普世宗教:** The emergence of religions like Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. These religions feature a *single, powerful, jealous, and often unpredictable God* who behaves much like the kings and emperors of that era. |

What these regions have in common? (Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam)

They often preach that there is **only one true god** or one true path to enlightenment.

## Extra Thinking

**How does Emile Durkheim's sociological definition of religion differ from a common-sense or theological one?**

1. *Focus on Function, Not Truth*: Sociology asks what religion *does* for a group, not whether its beliefs are true.
2. *Community is Essential*: Sense of collective belonging is more important than the specific belief.
- *The Sacred/Profane Distinction*: The core of religion is the act of setting certain things, places, and times apart as "sacred" and separate from the "profane" or everyday life.
- *God is Not Required*: The focus is on the community and the sacred.

**Explain how supporting a sports team can be considered a "religious" activity from a Durkheimian perspective.**

- *Sacred vs. Profane*: It creates a clear distinction between the sacred (the team's colors and logo, the stadium, the players' jerseys, game day) and the profane (all other teams, everyday clothing, a regular day).
- *Community of Worshippers*: It unites a large group of people (the fans) into a "moral community" with a very strong sense of belonging and solidarity. They feel a powerful connection to each other through their shared passion for the team.
- *Rituals*: The community engages in collective rituals that reinforce their bond, such as wearing the team's colors, singing team songs or chants, gathering to watch games, and celebrating victories together.
- *Totemism*: The team and its logo act as a modern-day totem. It is a symbol that the community gathers around to celebrate. In worshipping the "totem" (the team), the fans are really celebrating and reinforcing their collective identity and unity.
