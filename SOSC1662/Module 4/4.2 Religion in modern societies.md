Religion doesn't disappear, it simply changes its form to be more "broad, more general, more vague" to accommodate the diversity of modern life.

**Durkheim's quote:** "Thus there is something eternal in religion which is destined to survive all the particular symbols in which religious thought has successively enveloped itself. There can be no society which does not feel the need of upholding and reaffirming at regular intervals the collective sentiments and the collective ideas which make its unity and its personality."

> 因此，宗教中存在著某種永恆的東西，它注定要超越宗教思想接連包裹自身的所有特定符號。任何社會都必然需要定期維護和重申構成其統一性和個性的集體情感和集體理念。

## The Question of Religion in Modern Societies

What happens to religion in modern industrial societies? *Does it weaken, disappear, or get replaced by science and rationality?*

**Durkheim's Argument:** Religion does not disappear. ==It is an "eternal" aspect of society== because it fulfills a fundamental human need for collective life and social cohesion. However, its form changes to adapt to modern social structures.

## Modern Societies: Diversity and Individualism

**Characteristics of Modern Societies:**

- **Diversity:** Modern societies are characterized by a high degree of *specialization in occupations* and diverse lifestyles.
- **Individualism:** People in modern societies tend to see themselves as distinct individuals separate from the larger group.

**The Challenge for Religion:** In such diverse and individualistic societies, traditional religions (like Christianity, Islam, Judaism) become "restricted" to specific institutions (church, mosque, temple) and may not be able to unite everyone.

## New Forms of Religion in Modern Society

The lecture argues that new, more inclusive forms of "religion" emerge to **bind diverse populations together**. These are often *secular* but serve the same social functions as traditional religions.

**Examples of Modern "Religions"**:

### Nationalism 民族主義

- Unites people with different backgrounds, beliefs, and social classes under a **single national identity.**
- It has its own "totems" (flags), rituals (ceremonies, parades), and ways of dressing (in national colors).
- Examples: "The Allies - Onward to Victory" poster, *Nazi Germany*, the Soviet Union, and modern China.

### Communism 共產主義

- Officially atheist 無神論者, engage in religious-like activities.
- They have totems (portraits of leaders like Lenin 列寧, Stalin 史達林, Mao 毛澤東), elaborate ceremonies, uniforms, and songs that create a sense of solidarity.

### Democracy Movements

- Protest movements for ideals like democracy can serve the same function as religion.
- They unite people from diverse backgrounds around a shared cause.
- They create their own "totems" or symbols.

#### Examples in HKG

1. **The Umbrella Movement (2014)**: The yellow umbrella became a totem -> Protection.
2. **Anti-Extradition Bill Protests (2019)**: Umbrellas, helmets, and masks became totems. Statues like "Lady Liberty Hong Kong 香港自由女神 " -> powerful symbols.

### Consumerism and Corporate Branding

Corporations use marketing to create a sense of collective identity and belonging around their brands.

*Logos can become powerful "totems".* For example, the McDonald's golden arches 金色拱門 are more recognizable to many people than the Christian cross.

Brands like Benetton 貝納通 use slogans like "United Colors of Benetton" to *promote a sense of global community.*

### Celebrity Culture and Fandom

The world of celebrities and their fans exhibits religious-like practices.

Fans often dress like their idols (a form of imitatio dei 模仿上帝), creating a sense of solidarity with other fans.

Concerts and fan gatherings can be seen as powerful rituals that create *collective effervescence.*

### University Campus Activities

Activities like orientation camps provide an opportunity for new students to be integrated into a new collective identity, especially after leaving old friends behind.

Participation in these activities is often not for rational rewards (like grades or money) but for ==the feeling of belonging to something larger than oneself==. This *challenges the economic model of human behavior as purely rational.*

The link to the society is more attractive than the money.
