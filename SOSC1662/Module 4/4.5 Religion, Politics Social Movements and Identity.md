Religion, both Christianity and diffused Chinese religious practice is highly relevant in Hong Kong's politics, social movements, and the formation of local identity, particularly during the colonial period and in recent protests.

## The Visibility of Religion in Protests

Hong Kong is **NOT** a purely secular or apolitical society

Due to overt use of religious symbols, figures, and practices in major political movements like the 2014 Umbrella Movement and the 2019 Anti-Extradition Bill (Anti-ELAB) protests.

## Dual Role of Christianity

Christian symbols and hymns 讚美詩 were prominent in protests, often associated with calls for democracy and peace.

However, Christianity also has an established, institutional presence linked to the colonial elite.

## Diffused Chinese Religions as Protest

Beyond Christianity, local Chinese deities and folk practices have been largely ignored by observers but were *a vital part of the protest landscape*, helping to shape a unique local identity.

## Christian Presence in Social Movements

**Symbols and Slogans:** Christian themes were highly visible in recent protests.

- The 2014 Umbrella Movement was initially named **"Occupy Central with love and peace"**.
- The hymn **"Sing Hallelujah to the Lord"** became an unofficial anthem of the 2019 protests, used by protesters to maintain calm and occupy public space. (https://evchk.fandom.com/zh/wiki/Sing_Hallelujah_to_the_Lord)
- The popular protest song **"Glory to Hong Kong"** also has Christian undertones.

## Chinese Diffused Religions in Social Movements

**Beyond Christian Symbols:** Chinese religions were also present but often overlooked by observers.

### Deities as Protest Icons

**Wong Tai Sin**, a local deity, became a major figure in ==protest art==, often depicted wearing a gas mask to protest the police's use of tear gas.

Posters showed him "punishing evil" and rejecting tear gas, stating, "I don't eat smokes other than those from incense".

Other deities like **Guan Gong (關公)** and **Che Kung (車公)** were also used in artwork, shown as *victims* of "poisonous" expired tear gas.

### Folk Practices as Protest

- Shrines 神龕 were set up to commemorate protesters who had died.
- Protesters used traditional insults, calling police **"hungry ghosts" (餓鬼)** and **"canine spirits" (犬靈)**, and burned offensive paper offerings like dog houses for them.

## The "Co-option" of Institutional Religion

**Ting Guo's Thesis:** Ting Guo's argument that political powers have strategically used institutional religions for *ideological purposes.*

**British Colonialism & the Cold War:** The British co-opted Christianity, seeing it as an ally *against Communism* and a way to provide social services.

**The CCP:** The CCP has co-opted institutional ==Buddhism and Daoism==, linking them to patriotism and the party, which is why these institutions often appear less active in anti-government protests.

Result: "Christianity is linked to liberty," while institutional Chinese religions are associated with the pro-Beijing establishment.
