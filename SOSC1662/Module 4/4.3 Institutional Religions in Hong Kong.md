Many common spiritual practices in Hong Kong fall under the "diffuse" category.

## Institutional Religion

> Examples: *Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism.*

- Involves beliefs and rituals practiced within *a specific institution* like a church or a temple.
- These practices are typically *separate from daily life.*

## Diffuse Religion
