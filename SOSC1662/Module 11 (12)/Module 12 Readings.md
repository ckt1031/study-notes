## Question 3

In what ways were British (or Western-influenced) and Chinese views of Hong Kong's colonial history different?

---

**British/Western View**

- Depict pre-colonial Hong Kong as a "barren island" implying that *Britain single-handedly created its prosperity.*
- The Opium War is often framed as a *necessary "trade war"* between a modern nation and a stagnant one.

> One interviewee reflected, "without the Opium War, Hong Kong would not be what it is today!".

**Chinese View:**

- Portrays the Opium War as a brutal act of "invasion by British colonialism" to subjugate China (enslave the Chinese people with opium).
- Emphasizes the *historical humiliation of China* and casts Hong Kong's history as inseparable from mainland political movements, **thereby minimizing any sense of local autonomy.**

## Question 4

Among which social class did the distinctive Hong Kong identity emerge?

---

**Middle class**.

Gordon Mathews describes this group as the "backbone of Hong Kong's prosperity" whose "social and emotional ties to China *are relatively weak."*

## Question 5

What does Gordon Mathews see to be the future of the Heunggongyhahn? What new type of identity does he think will emerge? Can you describe it?

---

They remember the China of that era as a **"world that was closed and dark and strange."**

Their views were shaped by traumatic events, such as *seeing bodies float down from China and hearing harrowing stories of escape.*

This experience of China as chaotic and oppressive was a key factor **in their developing a separate Hong Kong identity.**

## Question 6

Was Gordon Mathews correct in his predictions?

---

> [!Predictions]  
> Mathews predicts that the distinct *Heunggongyàhn* identity will likely **"die out"** under increasing political and cultural pressure from mainland China.
>
> New identity could rise from its ashes: a resurgent, autonomous, and critical "Chinese" identity (*junggwokyahn*).  
> - Not a political identity tied to the PRC government
> - But a "cultural China" identity that champions universal values like **democracy and human rights**, potentially *influencing the mainland from its base in Hong Kong.*

**On one hand,** his prediction of ==immense pressure on Hong Kong's autonomy== has proven correct, and the political space for a distinct identity has certainly shrunk.

**On the other hand,** the *Heunggongyàhn* identity has ==not died out.==

Events after 1997, particularly major protest movements, suggest that this local identity has become *even more defined and politicized in opposition to mainland influence*, showing a resilience that may have surpassed Mathews' expectations.
