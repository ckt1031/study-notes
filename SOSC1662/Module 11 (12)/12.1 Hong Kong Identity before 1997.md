Not exclusive to Hong Kong.

## Historical Trajectory of Hong Kong Identity

### Early History: "A Part of China"

Contrary to the British colonial narrative of a "barren island"

Hong Kong was a **thriving trading center** for goods like salt and pearls long before 1841.

The inhabitants of this period **held a strong Chinese nationalist identity.**

### The 1950s: The "Immigrant Mentality"

Over 1M refugees fleeing mainland China arrived, focusing on *economic survival for their families rather than local politics or a sense of belonging.*

They were seen as hardworking and entrepreneurial, backbone of Hong Kong's industrial boom, but **many intended to return to China.**

### Late 1960s–1970s: The Emergence of a Distinct Identity

Crucial turning point where the view of *"Hong Kong being distinct from China" took root.*

**A New Local-Born Generation**: By the 1970s, half of the population had been born in Hong Kong and considered it their only home.

**The Cultural Revolution (1966-1976)**: Witnessing the *political turmoil* and *social chaos* on the mainland created a profound sense of **difference and a desire to forge a separate, stable identity.**

## Cultural Reinforcements of the "Hongkongese" Identity

### Global-Facing Film Industry

With ==access to Hollywood technology and creative freedom==, Hong Kong developed a world-renowned film industry, producing international kung fu stars like Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan.

### Embracing Western Culture

The **arrival of Western pop icons** like The Beatles in 1964 had a massive influence, inspiring a wave of local bands.

Ringo Starr, who had tonsillitis 扁桃腺炎 and stayed behind in the Philippines.

"Indicative of the economic circumstances in Hong Kong at the time… that Hong Kong is the only place where the Beatles lost money on their tour".

說明了當時香港的經濟狀況……香港是披頭四樂隊巡迴演出中唯一虧錢的地方

The reason for this financial loss was that while the band was extremely popular with the youth, "very few could **actually afford the tickets to see the show".**

### The Birth of Cantopop 粵語流行樂

Artists like **Sam Hui** blended *Western music with Cantonese lyrics and local themes.*

His songs, which often addressed the harsh working conditions of the lower and middle classes, **created a powerful and relatable local music genre.**

This tradition was carried on by superstars like the **"Four Heavenly Kings"** in the 1980s and 90s.

The rise of a strong local identity unfortunately *fostered negative views of mainland Chinese migrants.*

- The character **"Ah Chan" (阿燦)** from the 1979 TV drama *The Good, the Bad and the Ugly* came to personify this stereotype.
- He was **portrayed as uneducated, lazy, uncivilized, and ignorant of Hong Kong's social norms**, and his name became ==a widely used derogatory term for mainlanders.==
