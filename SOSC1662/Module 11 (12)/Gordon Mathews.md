## The Three Pillars of "Chineseness Plus"

Mathews breaks down identity distinct between HK and CN this "Hongkongese" identity into a concept.

### Affluence

**"Chineseness plus affluence/cosmopolitanism/capitalism"**

For example, one interviewee stated, "The best thing about Hong Kong is we can make lots of money hereâ€¦ it gives you choices".

### Colonialism

**"Chineseness plus English/colonial education/colonialism"**

For some, it was a "profound minus", the loss of their true Chinese identity.

For others, it was salvation, as one interviewee put it, "because Hong Kong was colonized it is civilized!".

### Democracy

**"Chineseness plus democracy/human rights/the rule of law"**

Political identity used to distinguish "Hongkongese" from the Chinese government, which is seen as authoritarian.

## China as a "Lost Mother"

The idea of China as an abandoned mother they longed for, a feeling that was often shattered upon **actually visiting the mainland and experiencing alienation** due to differences in ==affluence and social rules.==
