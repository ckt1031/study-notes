## The Politicization of Identity (Post-1997)

Caused by 1997 handover and the memory of the Tiananmen Square protests.

- A distinct "Hong Kong identity" became strongly associated with the **pro-democracy movement**.
- Key pro-democracy figures included Martin Lee and Emily Lau, while Chris Patten was the last British governor who introduced democratic reforms.

## The Official HKSAR Response: "Hong Kong as a Part of China"

The new HKSAR government actively promoted the idea of Hong Kong being **"a part of China".**

- **Tung Chee-hwa**, the first Chief Executive, stated, "We have to ==turn pro-China into a very positive definition==. It's a good thing to love our country".
- This narrative framed the pro-democracy movement and its supporters as being **"anti-China".**

### Two Competing Protests in 1996

#### Tiananmen Square Anniversary

This protest emphasized **Hong Kong as _apart_ from China**, a free place resisting Chinese government tyranny.

#### David Chan / Diaoyu Islands Protest

The 1996 memorial for **David Chan**, an activist who drowned protesting Japan's claim over the Diaoyu / Senkaku Islands 釣魚台/尖閣群島.

Emphasized **Hong Kong as a _part_ of China**, unified against Japanese "militarism".

> -> **A shared sense of national sovereignty** against an external rival.

## Cultural Shifts & More Complex Views

While politics created a clear divide, **popular culture** began presenting more nuanced views of mainland Chinese people.

### Television

The 1990s TV drama **"True Love" (真情)** portrayed Hong Kong _as having been founded by hardworking migrants from the mainland_, promoting ==a "we're all one Chinese family" message.==

**"Auntie Nice" (梁润好)**, was a mainlander _portrayed positively_ as wise, caring, tough, and fashionable, _fitting in seamlessly with Hong Kong society._

### Music: Cantopop Crisis

As noted by scholar Yiu-Wai Chu, **Cantopop** _faced a crisis in the late 1990s and early 2000s._

- The deaths of superstars Anita Mui and Leslie Cheung.
- The SARS epidemic.
- The rising popularity of
	- **Mandopop (from mainland China and Taiwan)**
	- J-pop
	- K-pop
	- American hip-hop.

## The Future of 香港人: A Surprise Turn

**Gordon Mathews** questioned what would become of the 香港人 identity after 1997. He posed three possibilities:

1. Will the 香港人 identity disappear as Hong Kong is absorbed into China?
2. Will Hong Kong people return to their Chinese cultural roots and become 中國人?
3. Will a new, critical, and independent type of 中國人 emerge from Hong Kong?

**Contrary to predictions**, the 香港人 identity did not disappear.  
It became **even stronger** in the decade that followed.

This strengthening was driven by the rise of **"localist movements"** that actively sought to _preserve a distinct Hong Kong identity._

## "Localist Movements" In Action

> Socio-economic friction between Hong Kong residents and visitors from mainland China.

### "Locust" Campaign

A controversial 2012 campaign protested **mainland women giving birth in Hong Kong to secure residency for their children.**

An advertisement in _Apple Daily_ depicted mainlanders as **locusts**, asking if Hong Kong should spend millions to raise "their" children.

### Anti-Parallel Trading Protests

Campaigns targeted mainland residents who _bought large quantities of goods (like milk powder, cosmetics) in Hong Kong for resale in China_, a practice known as "parallel trading" (水貨客).

### Common Blame

Localists framed mainland visitors **as responsible for overcrowding, rising prices, and "uncivilized" behavior** (being noisy, eating on transport, jumping queues), echoing the old [[12.1 Hong Kong Identity before 1997#Social Consequence The "Ah Chan" Stereotype|"Ah Chan" stereotype]].

### Scholarism 學民思潮

A student-led group that successfully protested against the proposed introduction of **Moral and National Education** in schools, which they saw as _a push for "patriotic" brainwashing_.

Some members later formed the political party **Demosistō**. (香港眾志)

### Academic Support

==Localism== gained intellectual backing from figures like Lingnan University professor **Horace Chin**, who authored _Hong Kong City-State Theory_.

## Preservation Projects as a Form of Localism

### The Heritage Movement

Campaigns emerged to **protect monuments** from Hong Kong's **colonial past**, framing them as unique parts of local history.

- The 2006 protest against relocating the **Queen's Pier Clock Tower**
- Save traditional street markets like **Graham Street Market** from redevelopment.

### The Conservation Movement (The "Ecology of Difference")

Anthropologist Tim Choi argues that environmental campaigns focus on _species and places unique to Hong Kong._

**Pink dolphins** -> they are found specifically in Hong Kong waters.  
**Mai Po Wetlands** -> a rare resting place for specific migratory birds.

Around 1997, botanists discovered ==new plant species==, like _Spiranthes hongkongensis_, described as similar to **but distinct** from mainland varieties (_Spiranthes sinensis_).

## Statistical Evidence: How Hong Kongers See Themselves

A **2017 HKU poll** showed a weak identification with a national Chinese identity, ==especially among youth.==

- Respondents identified more as **"Asians" or "global citizens"** than as "citizens of the PRC".
- Only **3.1%** of young people (18-29) identified primarily as "Chinese".

## The Rise of a "Hybrid Identity"

Scholar Anthony Fung argues _the reality is more complex than a simple rejection of Chinese identity._

Survey data over time shows a **decline in people identifying solely as "Chinese"** but a ==significant increase== in those identifying as **"Hong Kong citizen, but also Chinese"**.

> **Hybrid or "but also" identity**, where individuals hold multiple identities simultaneously.  
> This is a common phenomenon in a globalized world (e.g., _British and Muslim_, American and Chinese).

## A Sociological Explanation

Hong Kong identity is **complex and fluid**, often shifting ==based on context== (e.g., feeling more "English" during a football match against Italy).

Regional identity tensions ==are not unique to China== (e.g., the UK's potential breakup, Spain's five distinct linguistic nations).

_Rather than blaming_ either the Chinese government or localists, a more sociological explanation points to **British colonialism**.

**Over 100 years of separation** created **two different societies** with distinct legal, political, and social systems. The tensions seen today are a common feature of **post-colonial societies**, where ==decolonization creates deep and lasting divisions.==
