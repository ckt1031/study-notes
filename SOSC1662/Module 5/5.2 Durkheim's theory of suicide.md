- Act of suicide, while seemingly personal, is profoundly influenced by social forces.
- Suicide rates within a society are a "social fact", a reflection of the health of the society itself, particularly *the degree of social integration* and *moral regulation* it provides to its members.

## Social Forces Drive Suicide Rates

*Suicide*, revealed that suicide rates increase **as nations become more industrialized and capitalist.**

Not only economic hardship, changes in the social fabric left *individuals feeling disconnected and without guidance.*

Groups or societies with either excessively weak or excessively strong ties of social integration and regulation have higher suicide rates.

### Religion: Protestants vs. Catholics

Predominantly Protestant countries had significantly higher suicide rates than Catholic ones.

Not because of differing doctrines on suicide *(both forbid it)*, but because of their ==social structures.==

Catholicism fosters higher social integration through its many collective rituals (e.g., Mass, confession), numerous festivals, and a rigid, centralized hierarchy.

In contrast, Protestantism encourages more individual freedom of belief and interpretation and has fewer collective rituals, leading to **lower social integration.**

**An Important Exception**: Jewish people, despite being highly educated (a group Durkheim linked to higher suicide), had low suicide rates. Durkheim attributed this to their strong sense of community and family obligation, forged in part by facing ==widespread persecution and discrimination.==

### Marital Status & Gender

Statistics show that **men are more likely to commit suicide than women**. Similarly, **single men are more likely** to do so than married men.

Women and married men *were more deeply integrated into family life*. Family obligations regulate their lives and bind them more closely to a community, protecting them from the despair of isolation.

### Education: Educated vs. Non-Educated

Educated individuals have higher suicide rates than the uneducated.  

Education encourages *critical thinking and questioning of traditional societal beliefs*, including religion. This intellectual individualism can set people ==apart from their community==, weakening their social bonds.

### Social & Economic Conditions

**War and Peace:** Paradoxically, *suicide rates are lower during times of war* and higher during times of peace. Durkheim explained that war ==enhances collective life==. It brings people together through a shared sense of nationalism and purpose, and even shared grief through rituals like funerals, thereby increasing social integration.

**Economic Booms and Recessions:** Suicide rates rise during periods of both economic recession and economic boom. This seemingly contradictory finding highlights a key concept: **disruption**. Both conditions disrupt the established social order and everyday relationships. People may have to move, find new jobs, or lose their jobs, leading to a state of ==normlessness== (a concept Durkheim called *anomie*) where society's regulatory influence is weakened.

## The Problem of Modernity

Durkheim's work on suicide was part of a broader critique of modern ==capitalist== society.

He identified some factors that contribute to a *general state of unhappiness*:

### Excessive Individualism

Modern society emphasizes **individual choice** in everything from career to religion.

While this can be liberating, it also means individuals **bear the full weight of their failures**, with no one else to blame.

### Raised Hopes and Envy

Capitalism raises hope, everyone with effort can become the boss, but it also comes with disappointment and envy of others.

### The Weakening of Religion, Nation, and Family

Traditional institutions that once provided a strong sense of community, belonging, and moral guidance have lost their hold.

Religion, which offered communal solace, has become less plausible for many, and science cannot provide the same powerful, shared experiences. The nation and the modern family are also less stable and binding than in the past.
