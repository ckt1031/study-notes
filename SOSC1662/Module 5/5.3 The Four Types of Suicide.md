Durkheim's analysis is centered on two fundamental social forces that describe the individual's relationship with society: Integration and Regulation.

- **Integration** is how much people join in and share their society's beliefs, feelings, and values. This is often called the "collective consciousness." It includes ties to family, religious groups, social clubs, or sports teams.
- **Regulation** shows how much society limits a person's actions and desires. It does this through rules, routines, and principles.

Durkheim categories into 4 types of suicide, each caused by an excess or deficiency in integration or regulation.

## The Four Types of Suicide

### Egoistic Suicide: Low Integration

When an individual feels detached from their community and social groups.

This lack of integration leads to a sense of not belonging and excessive individualism, *where the person's ties to society are weakened.*

In Durkheim's words, "Individuals cling to life more resolutely when they belong to a group they love".

**Protestants**: Durkheim noted they have *fewer collective religious ceremonies* than Catholics, fostering more individualism.

**Single Men**: They tend to have *fewer family responsibilities* and connections compared to married men.

**The Elderly or Migrants**: Individuals in these groups may find themselves living *far from family* or in a new country where they lack social connections.

### Altruistic Suicide: High Integration

The opposite of egoistic suicide, altruistic suicide happens when integration is excessively high.

The individual's identity is so absorbed by the group that *they are willing to sacrifice their life for what the group* deems the greater good.

**Military Sacrifice**: During World War II, Japanese generals encouraged soldiers to fly their planes into American warships, sacrificing themselves for their nation.

**Religious Cults**: A cult leader might command followers to commit mass suicide.

**Copycat Suicides**: Social media groups or celebrity suicides can sometimes encourage vulnerable, highly-integrated members to take their own lives.

### Anomic Suicide: Low Regulation

{roduct of "anomie," a state of normlessness where society fails to provide clear rules and guidelines for living.

This often occurs during periods of *rapid social or economic change*, leaving individuals with **too many choices, too much freedom, and a sense of disorientation 迷失感**.

Durkheim saw anomie and egoism as the primary dysfunctions of the modern era.

**Economic Disruption**:

Lottery winners who suddenly have vast wealth but no guidance on how to manage their new life may feel lost.

Similarly, a longtime worker who suddenly retires or becomes unemployed loses their daily routine and structure. This explains why suicide rates rise during **both economic booms and recessions.**

**Life Transitions**:

The transition from the structured environment of high school to the freedom and choice of university can be a form of anomie for some students.

### Fatalistic Suicide: High Regulation

Fatalistic suicide occurs in societies with excessive regulation, where individuals feel totally oppressed and constrained by rules and expectations.

Their future appears blocked, and they see no escape from a life of cruel demands and discipline.
