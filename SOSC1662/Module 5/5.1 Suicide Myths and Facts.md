While it may seem like a tough and strange topic, studying suicide is crucial **for understanding societal well-being**.

In Hong Kong in 2020, suicide was a *more frequent cause of death than both COVID-19* infections and traffic accidents combined.

Globally, *more people die from suicide than in all of the world's armed conflicts*. In the United States, despite high-profile stories about gun violence, over half of all gun-related fatalities in 2021 were suicides.

Sociological perspective examines the broader relationship *between the individual and society*, revealing that the social forces influencing suicide can be ==predictable==.

## Global & Cross-Country Comparisons

*Patterns* can be found in different suicide rates across different countries.

In 2019, countries with some of the highest rates included Lesotho, Guyana, Eswatini, and the Republic of Korea (South Korea).

**High-Rate Countries**

Countries like *South Korea* and *former Soviet republics* consistently show high rates.

Factors contributing to this include ==aging populations== in South Korea and ==high unemployment among men== following the collapse of the Soviet Union. High-profile celebrity suicides in South Korea *have been a factor.*

**Low-Rate Countries**

Conversely, countries with the lowest rates include the *Philippines* and several Latin American nations like *Honduras and Venezuela*.

> [!Why?]  
> Commonality in religion.  
> They are predominantly Catholic, **religious beliefs is protective factor against suicide.**

Be cautious with suicide statistics from states with ==brutal and corrupt police forces==.

The reason given is that the police may kill a suspect and then report the death as a suicide.

## Myth 1: Suicide Rates Are High and Rising in Hong Kong

This is a *misconception*.

When compared to the G8 countries in 2019, Hong Kong's suicide rate ranked in the *middle—lower than Russia*, the United States, Japan, and France, *but higher than Germany, Canada, Britain, and Italy.*

Hong Kong's overall suicide rate ==remained relatively stable== between 2005 and 2021, though there were peaks *around the time of SARS in 2003 and again in 2022 during the COVID-19 pandemic.*

The suicide rate has decreased by **29% since the year 2000**. Significant drops have been seen in Russia, Japan, South Korea, India, and China, largely attributed to factors like *reduced unemployment in Russia* and *increased opportunities for rural women in China and India.*

## Myth 2: Suicide is Mostly a Teenage or Youth Problem

Data from Hong Kong *clearly refutes this idea.*

**The Elderly are Most at Risk:** In Hong Kong, individuals *aged 65 and above* have consistently had the highest suicide rates, while young people *have the lowest.*

**Impact of Pandemics:** The vulnerability of the elderly was especially evident during the SARS outbreak. *From March to June 2003, the suicide rate among the elderly increased by a staggering 31.7%.* This was linked to fears among younger family members of visiting their elderly relatives in public housing and potentially transmitting the virus.

> If the elderly have the highest rates, why was there *so much focus* on youth suicide during the COVID-19 pandemic?

While the elderly suicide rate remained the highest overall during the COVID-19 period, the ==rate== for young people experienced the *greatest increase*. Rate for those under 15 reached a historical **high**. It's about mental health impacts of **class suspensions and disruptions to normal life.**

## Myth 3: The Stress of City Life Drives People to Suicide

Not supported by evidence.

**The U.S. Case:** In the United States, *lowest suicide rates are highly urbanized* ones like New Jersey, New York, and Massachusetts. The highest rates are found in rural states such as Wyoming, Alaska, and Montana.

**The Hong Kong Case:** Similarly, in Hong Kong, the highest rates are not in the bustling commercial centers but **in outlying areas with a high density of public housing.** In 2005, the suicide rate for public housing residents *was 2.1 times higher than for those in private housing.*

> Why are suicide rates higher in public housing estates if not because of density?

The issue is not the buildings themselves but the social conditions within them. High proportion of elderly residents, large numbers of immigrants:

1. Strangers to each other with little neighborhood contact
2. High unemployment rates
3. Geographically isolated from commercial centers

## Myth 4: Restricting Access to Lethal means Has Little Effect

Interventions has big effect.

**Primary Methods in Hong Kong:** Unlike in the U.S. where *firearms* are common, the primary methods of suicide in Hong Kong are ==jumping from a height and charcoal burning.==

**Effective Prevention**:

1. **Barriers:** After glass barriers were installed at a known suicide hotspot on the eighth floor of Times Square, no further deaths were reported. The installation of screen doors on MTR platforms has also significantly *reduced railway suicides.*
2. **Restricting Charcoal Sales:** A study compared two districts. In Tuen Mun, where stores locked up charcoal and only provided it on request, *deaths by charcoal burning dropped by nearly half*. In Yuen Long, where access was not restricted, suicide rates rose during the same period.

> If a person is truly determined, won't they just find another way?

Suicide is often a spontaneous or impulsive act.  
By preventing an attempt on a particular occasion, it's possible to prevent it **permanently** or at least buy **enough time** for the person **to get help.**

## Myth 5: Suicide is a Purely Individual Decision

Socially contagious.

**The Leslie Cheung Effect 張國榮效應:** In 2003, after he died by suicide, there was a noticeable spike in suicides, particularly *among young men*, compared to the same period in previous years.

**The Marilyn Monroe Effect:** In 1962, after hers death, researchers *found a 12% increase* in the number of suicides across the United States *in the months that followed.*
