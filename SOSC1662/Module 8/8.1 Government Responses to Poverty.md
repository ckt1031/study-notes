## Pre-Minimum Wage Policy: The Wage Protection Movement (2006)

**Background**: In the mid-2000s, wages for many unskilled workers in Hong Kong were falling. In 2006, the government ==rejected== calls for a _mandatory_ minimum wage.

**Initiative**: Proposed the "Wage Protection Movement," a _voluntary_ scheme for cleaners and security guards.

### Proposed Rates

- **General Cleaners**: HK$25 per hour.
- **Toilet Cleaners**: HK$22 per hour.

### Failures and Loopholes

**Low Compliance**: Being ==voluntary==, only 10% of employers joined the scheme.

**Worker Reclassification**: Compliant employers avoided paying the set rates by ==changing job titles==. For example, "cleaners" were renamed "shop staff" or "general workers" to be paid less. "General cleaners" were re-designated as "toilet cleaners" to qualify for the lower HK$22 rate.

**Outsourcing Issues**: The scheme was often not ==applied to outsourced workers==, even those working on government contracts. **The Hospital Authority 醫院管理局** was cited as a major offender.

### Consequences

The clear failure of this _voluntary_ approach created the ==political momentum for a mandatory policy.==

## Mandatory Minimum Wage (2011)

**Introduction**: Implemented in 2011, initially at ==HK$28== per hour.

**Rate Increases**: The rate has been increased over the years. It is set to rise from HKD $40 to HKD $42.10 in May 2025.

### Economic Debate

**Traditional View**: The conventional economic model of supply and demand suggests that ==making labor more expensive== (by setting a minimum wage) will lead to employers wanting less of it, causing ==unemployment==.

**Modern Research**: More recent empirical studies, such as the 1992 Card and Kruger study on fast-food restaurants in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, challenge this view.

They found that an increase in the **minimum wage did not lead to job losses** and, in some cases, employment even increased. This is sometimes explained by the **concept of "monopsony 買方壟斷 "** where employers have power to keep wages artificially low, and a minimum wage can correct this without causing job cuts.

> Monopoly: one dominant supplier and many buyers; monopsony: one buyer (or employer in this case) and many suppliers (workers in this case)

## Effects of the Minimum Wage in Hong Kong

### Positive and Neutral Impacts

**Unemployment**: Joblessness _fell_ from 3.5% to 3.2% after the law came into effect and remained stable a year later.

**Business Closures**: There was no significant rise in the number of companies being dissolved, suggesting businesses ==could absorb the costs.==

**Limited Cost Impact**: For many businesses like _restaurants_, wages only constitute about 38% of production costs, ==high rent and food costs== are more significant financial pressures.

### Negative Impacts and Criticisms

**Employer Tactics**: Some employers **cut the number of hours** workers could work. Others avoided paying for full shifts by **excluding lunch breaks** or **classifying work hours as "voluntary".**

**Hiring Difficulties**: Some groups complained it became harder for them to find work, including students seeking internships, the disabled, and those with few qualifications.

**Increased Costs for Property Owners**: The policy led to large wage increases for security guards, with monthly earnings reaching HK$10,420, noted as being _higher than some office workers_ (though this is due to very long working hours).

## Core Issue: Adequacy of the Minimum Wage

**Income vs. Cost of Living**: The central criticism is whether the minimum wage can provide for basic necessities.

### A Monthly Budget on Minimum Wage

- **Wage**: Working 10 hours a day for 26 days a month at HK40 per hour yields **HK10,400**.  
- **Housing**: The median rent for a subdivided flat is **HK$5,000**, consuming nearly half of the monthly income.

### Inadequacy for Real Life

This leaves very little for all other expenses. It is especially insufficient for individuals with additional responsibilities, such as:

- Childcare
- Caring for elderly parents
- Medical expenses, where a simple item like a bottle of shampoo or a box of Tylenol could _consume a significant portion of a daily budget_.
