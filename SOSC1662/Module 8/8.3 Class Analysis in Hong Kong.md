## Historical Evolution of Hong Kong's Class Structure

### 1950s Colonial Era

Society was divided into three distinct classes:

1. **British Ruling Class:** The colonial administrators and elite.
2. **Local Chinese Elites:** A small, influential group.
3. **Chinese Masses:** Primarily recent migrants from mainland China who worked as laborers and factory workers.

### Emergence of the "New Middle Classes"

Consisted of professionals, administrators, technicians, and clerical workers who advanced from the working class.

Typically received a **Western-style education locally.**

Influenced by the ==social protests== of the 1960s and 70s, they **held liberal, democratic values and sought a higher quality of life.**

## Sociological Studies on Social Mobility

### Wong and Lui's "Class Map" (1992)

> **Methodology:** Surveyed 1,000 male heads of household to map Hong Kong's class structure.

- Higher-grade professionals  
- Lower-grade professionals
- Routine non-manual workers
- Small business owners
- Supervisors of manual workers
- Skilled manual workers  
- Semi-skilled and unskilled workers  

**Class Definition:** Used an ==occupation-based model== with seven classes, ranging from higher-grade professionals (Class 1) to ==unskilled workers (Class 7).==

**Initial Findings (1992):**

About ==52.5% of respondents had moved away from their father's class position==, indicating social mobility.

However, mobility was unequal. The chances for someone **from Class 1 to remain in Class 1** were ==eight times higher than for someone from Class 7 to move up to that level.==

Those from intermediate, **non-manual classes (3-5) were three times more likely to move up** than those from the lowest class.

> Once again, here we see it is the non-manual classes that have a better chance of moving up from the manual classes that appear to be stuck at the bottom

### Follow-up Study (2006)

**Increased Mobility:** Mobility had risen significantly, with ==76.9%== of respondents in a different class than their fathers.

**Persistent Inequality:** The non-manual (middle) classes were most likely to move, while the ==upper classes were effective at preventing their children from downward mobility==. The manual/working classes remained "stuck at the bottom".

### Wong and Koo's Study (Post-Handover Data from 1989 & 2007)

**Absolute Mobility:** Confirmed an *expanding middle class* and the creation of more desirable jobs, indicating positive absolute mobility.

**Relative Inequality:**

Despite this, "middle-class sons still ==stand a good chance of remaining in an expanding middle class,==" while "working-class sons still tend to be ==retained in a shrinking working class==".

This shows that while the overall structure improved, the **relative chances for the working class to advance remained low.**

## The Role of Education in Social Mobility

### Family Income and University Access (Wu Xiaogang, 2011)

Historically, **family economic resources** played a significant role in university attainment.

However, the influence of income is **declining**.

A 10% increase in a father's income improved the odds of getting a university education by 8.5% in 1981, but **only by 2.6% in 2001.**

This is likely due to the ==expansion of university places in Hong Kong.==

### The Rise of Social and Cultural Capital

While income's role has diminished, a family's **social and cultural resources** have become more important.

This includes factors like a father's ==managerial position== or parents' ==own high levels of education.==

### The Limits of a University Degree Today

#### Degree Inflation

The expansion of university education has led to "degree inflation." There are many more graduates, but a limited supply of high-level managerial positions.

#### Underemployment

This results in tertiary graduates filling junior clerical jobs that would not have required a degree in the past.

> Consequently, many highly educated young people end up in junior-level jobs that do not match their qualifications, making their entry into the established middle class less certain than it was for their predecessors.

#### Persistent Disadvantage

**A degree is less helpful for those from poorer backgrounds.**

Degree holders from ==poor families== (identified as living in public housing) are **less likely to enter the middle class** compared to graduates from wealthier families. Younger generations with degrees also have a **lower chance of becoming middle class** than previous generations.

> Class still plays a role in your life regardless of your academic qualifications
