## Additional Information

**Rentier Capitalism 租賃資本主義**: An economic model where a government earns its income not by taxing private businesses in a competitive market, but by owning and controlling assets (like land) that generate "economic rent." According to _The Economist_, industries with high levels of state interaction, typical in rentier systems, are highly vulnerable to cronyism.

**Crony Capitalism 裙帶資本主義**: An economic system where success in business depends on close, mutually beneficial relationships between businesspeople and government officials. The lecture highlights an index from _The Economist_ that ranked Hong Kong first in crony capitalism in 2007 and 2014.

## Case Studies in Corporate Welfare

### The Cyberport Project (1999)

**Stated Goal**: To launch Hong Kong's high-tech manufacturing industry and create a "Silicon Valley" equivalent.

**The Deal**: The government awarded the 26-hectare project to Pacific Century CyberWorks (PCCW), owned by Richard Li 李澤楷擁有的盈科拓展集團, ==without any competitive tender process.==

### The Reality of 1999 Cyberport Project

**Failed to create new businesses**

- 18 of the 33 initial tenants were existing companies that relocated to **take advantage of cheaper rent.**
- **DID NOT** attract foreign investment or create new jobs as intended.
- Between 2001 and 2004, the Cyberport **accumulated losses** of HK$203 million.

**The Critique**: This project is presented as a classic example of corporate welfare.

The government ==bypassed a public land auction==, which could have generated an estimated HK$23.4 billion, effectively granting a ==valuable property development opportunity to a tycoon under the cover of a tech initiative.==

### The Lok Ma Chau Loop Project

**Stated Goal**: To create a high-tech factory zone near the Shenzhen border to _bring factories back to Hong Kong_ and foster economic integration with the mainland. The project was supported by legislators, including Li Ka-shing.

#### The Critique and Problems

Critics questioned why the site was **so far** from the Hong Kong population and why existing industrial areas **were not regenerated instead**.

There were concerns about **potential unemployment** for Hong Kong workers and the **environmental destruction** of the Mai Po wetlands.

**Suspected Motive**: The landowners ==were not identified== but were suspected to be property developers.

The suspicion was that if the government provided essential infrastructure (water, sewers, roads) for free, this "worthless" piece of land ==could be transformed into a site for profitable luxury housing==, paid for by the public.
