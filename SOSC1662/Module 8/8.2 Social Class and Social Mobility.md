## Introduction: Can Anyone "Make It"?

Social mobility in societies unlimited in Hong Kong?

There are high-profile examples to explore whether the social class we are born into determines our future success.

**Donald Tsang:** Former Chief Executive of Hong Kong who grew up in a *poor housing estate.*

**Chen Shui-bian:** Former President of Taiwan who came from a *poor rural village.*

**Other Examples:** The lecture also mentions self-made billionaires like Li Ka-shing, J.K. Rowling (author of Harry Potter), and Oprah Winfrey (American talk show host), who all started from poor backgrounds.

These success stories might suggest that ==class doesn't matter== and that **anyone with talent and determination can succeed.** This leads to the core questions of the lecture:

1. Do we live in a class-based society?
2. To **what extent** can individuals move up from the social class they were born into?

## Defining Social Class

To analyze social mobility, we must first understand what "social class" means.

So, in simple terms, **social class is your position in society based on your combined level of wealth, power, and respect (prestige).** It affects the opportunities you get in life.

### Karl Marx's Definition

In capitalist societies, there are fundamentally two classes based on the **ownership of the "means of production"** (factories, businesses, property).

1. **Bourgeoisie (Capitalists):** The owners who control the means of production.
2. **Proletariat (Working Class):** The non-owners who must ==sell their labor== to the bourgeoisie to earn a living wage.

#### Limitations of Marx's Model

- The model is seen as too **simplistic** for modern societies.
- Struggles to categorize people who **don't fit neatly into either group**, such as university students (who don't own factories but whose education may lead to ownership) or managers (who don't own the business but control its resources).
- Many people today identify **as "middle class"** and may own stocks or shares, complicating the owner/non-owner division.

### Max Weber's Multidimensional Approach

Weber argued that social stratification is **not just about economic class** but is based on three distinct, though often related, components:

1. **Class:** A person's economic opportunities and life chances, similar to Marx's concept.
2. **Status:** Social prestige or honor. A person might have ==high status without being wealthy== (e.g., a respected professor or a religious leader).
3. **Party:** Power derived from being a member of *influential organizations* like trade unions or professional associations (e.g., the American Medical Association), which provide benefits and advance the interests of their members.

## Defining Social Mobility

Social mobility refers to the movement of individuals or groups between different social class positions.

### Absolute Mobility

This refers to overall societal progress where the number of "good" jobs and opportunities ==increases== for everyone **due to structural changes in the economy.**

**Driving Forces:** It is driven by factors like new technologies, economic growth, and the creation of new industries.

> The growth of Silicon Valley due to computer technology created widespread wealth and new, better-paying jobs, lifting many people up regardless of their starting point.

### Relative Mobility

This measures the extent to which an individual can move away from the social class they were born into. It is about the chances of moving up (or down) compared to others.

**Focus:** Unlike absolute mobility, relative mobility is concerned with the ==fairness of the system==. It examines whether a person's background determines their destiny or if there is a level playing field.
