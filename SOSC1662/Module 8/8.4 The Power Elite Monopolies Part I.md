Concept of the power elite as it applies to Hong Kong, focusing on the dominance of business monopolies and their relationship with the government.

## The Power Elite Framework

In Hong Kong, the power elite is demonstrated by the ==overlap between immense business wealth and political influence.== Examples include C.H. Tung, Hong Kong's first Chief Executive, who was also a **shipping magnate**. This model is also seen in other political figures who have deep ties to business and industry.

In [[8.2 Social Class and Social Mobility#Max Weber's Multidimensional Approach|Max Weber's Multidimensional Approach]], class, status and party interrelated.

### C. Wright Mills' Theory

The concept of "The Power Elite," developed by sociologist C. Wright Mills in 1956, posits that a ==small, interconnected group holds power across the key institutions== of society. These institutions are the government, the military, and business.

## The "Four Families" and Market Domination

A few powerful family-run conglomerates dominate vast sectors of the Hong Kong economy, creating monopolies that affect every aspect of daily life.

### Key Tycoons and Their Empires

#### Li Ka-shing

Controls businesses in retail (Park'n'Shop, Watsons, Fortress), property, hotels (Harbour Hotels), and utilities (Hong Kong Electric).

#### Thomas and Raymond Kwok

Dominate transport (KMB, Wilson Parking), telecommunications (Smartone), property (IFC, New Town Plaza), and hotels (Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton).

#### Lee Shau-kee

Controls property (Henderson Land), utilities (Towngas), and hotels (Miramar Hotels).

#### Cheng Yu Tung

Leads in transport (City Bus, New World Ferries, Tate's Cairn Tunnel), property (New World Development), retail (Sogo, Chow Tai Fook Jewelry), and telecommunications (CSL).

### Impact of Monopolies

This concentration of ownership means that nearly every dollar a resident spends filters back to these tycoons.

#### Property

- In 2006, just three developers dominated ==the private residential market==.
- Home prices have doubled in a decade while wages have stagnated.
- Developers hold massive stocks of farmland that could be used for public housing.
- A lot of this land is hoarded by a **decreasing number of property developers.**

#### Supermarkets

There are only **two main supermarket chains** because potential competitors, like Carrefour, could not secure suitable premises, as the ==major landlords are the tycoons themselves.==

#### Transport & Utilities

Companies like KMB and the major electricity providers **enjoy government concessions**, operate as monopolies, and can raise prices with little resistance. ==The government uses taxpayer money to subsidize them.==

## Government, Functional Constituencies, and "Corporate Welfare"

### Functional Constituencies

The political structure of the Hong Kong Legislative Council (LegCo) reinforces the power of the elite. A significant portion of seats are filled by "Functional Constituencies," where a small number of voters from specific business sectors hold disproportionate power.

==This system is accused of distorting the free market.==

### "Corporate Welfare"

The system encourages "corporate welfare," which is defined as **irresponsible government spending** where ==money is given to wealthy people instead of poor people.==

- Providing handouts, subsidies, and free land to the rich.
- A reluctance to introduce **strong competition laws.**
- Discourages competition and ==allows monopolies to thrive==

## Conspiracy or Unintended Consequence?

- Mills argued that the existence of the ==power elite was not the result of a deliberate conspiracy.==
- In Hong Kong, the **functional constituencies** were originally ==intended to increase democracy and representation==, but they have ==had the opposite effect.==
- Job of a sociologist to ==understand the "unintended consequences" of such actions==, rather than attributing them to intentional plots.
