<span style="font-size: 20">How did Hong Kong's richest and most powerful families originally make their fortunes?</span>

1. They **owe fortunes to land**.
2. The lack of **competition law** created outrageous wealth for the tycoons.
3. A system that allowed a few families to **acquire cheap land before the city's boom** paved the way for them to become unimaginably wealthy. These families **had already earned initial capital from trading or manufacturing**. It's noted that it arguably took "guts and vision" to accumulate landholdings, especially during the city's turmoil in 1967-68. This same group of developers **went on to construct a significant portion of today's mass-market private housing**.

<span style="font-size: 20">How did the early British colonial administration keep their taxes so low?</span>

1. Attracted business
2. Side-effect was that it gave the government the interest in rationing land to **keep it expensive**.

<span style="font-size: 20">From whom did the "Mom&Pop" stores face the most competition?</span>

1. Tycoons
2. Debatable extortionate rent prices. But actually top convenient stores/supermarkets kills little family-owned store.

<span style="font-size: 20">List all the ways in which the government contributes to the profits of the tycoons.</span>

**Land and Property Policies**

1. **Maintaining High Prices and Scarce Supply**: Maintains a "high land price" policy.
2. **Making Property Acquisition Easier**: In 2010, the government lowered the threshold required for developers to force a sale of old buildings from 90% owner agreement to just 80%
3. **Providing "Free" Space for Profit**: Developers then include this "bonus space" in the advertised floor area of apartments, turning a government concession directly into their own profit.
4. **Using Discretionary Power and Loopholes**:
	1. "Mysterious loopholes": Tower blocks are often built taller than official height limits
	2. Land sold cheaply for hotels is redeveloped into much more profitable serviced apartments.
5. **Awarding Non-Competitive Projects**: Awarding major development projects to single developers or consortiums without open competition.

**Tax, Investment, and Subsidy Schemes**

1. **Funneling Tax Breaks to Developers**: Tax deducted for homebuyers on mortgage interest payments ==don't lower costs for the buyer==. Instead, they allow developers to raise apartment prices by a similar amount, effectively making it a subsidy for the sellers.

<span style="font-size: 20">How does the government benefit from helping the tycoons?</span>

1. High land price policy **raises government revenue while keeping visible taxes down**.
2. Our government officials **are tycoons in disguise**. Certainly, they like ==easy land revenues== and the power they get from overseeing giant infrastructure schemes.
3. The political structure is systematically pro-tycoon.
	1. Functional constituencies in which a few business interests can choose a *large chunk of the legislature* and the body that pretends to elect the chief executive.
	2. Officials and chief executives need their votes.
4. **Maintaining Stability**: The central government in Beijing is said to rely on the tycoons to help keep Hong Kong stable, which in turn influences the local government's actions.
