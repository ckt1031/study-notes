## Globalization and Its Consequences

Globalization is broadly defined as the process by which organizations or businesses **develop international influence and operate on a global scale**. This includes multinational corporations, trade agreements, military alliances like NATO, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) such as the Red Cross and UNICEF.

Polish sociologist Zygmunt Bauman 齊格蒙特​​·鮑曼 highlighted the profound human **consequences of globalization**, which include:

- **Growing Inequalities:** A significant outcome of globalization is the rise in ==economic disparities, both within and between countries==. For instance, the Gini coefficient for wage inequality in **Hong Kong has shown an upward trend over the past few decades**.
- **The "McDonaldization" of Society:** ==Market-based ideologies are increasingly applied to all areas of social life, including education, social welfare, and healthcare.== This concept, often called "McDonaldization," promotes principles of efficiency, standardization, and measurable outcomes across various sectors, much like the fast-food chain operates globally.
- **Deregulation and Job Insecurity:** Globalization has led to deregulation, privatization, and liberalization. With many companies operating offshore, ==government regulation and support have diminished.== This has resulted in increased risks of company mergers, downsizing, outsourcing, and overall job insecurity, with a shift towards short-term contracts. Consequently, ==jobs are more easily moved to countries where labor laws may be less stringent than in developed nations.==

## Gender

While there has been progress in gender equality, with women holding high-profile positions such as the former Chief Executive of the HKSAR and the Vice President of the United States, ==significant disparities remain==. Women continue to be underrepresented in international politics and many other spheres of life, including in China. ==Furthermore, women's rights are under threat in many countries experiencing political instability.==

## The Changing Family and Youth

**Marriage:** Historically, and in many traditional societies today, ==marriages were arranged for economic and political reasons.== For women who could not work, marriage was the sole means of **financial support**. In modern societies, individuals now navigate a "marriage market" to find partners, **often seeking romantic love rather than just material security**.

### Role of Youth

**Historical Context:** Until the early 20th century, it was **common for children to work in factories and coal mines**. They were also subject to adult laws and could even be recruited into the army, as seen during World War I.

**Modern Youth:** Today, there is a clear distinction between the lives of children and adults. Young people are **expected to pursue education in comfortable environments** and enjoy leisure activities specifically designed for them.

## Changing Religious Beliefs

There is a ==notable weakening of traditional religious institutions== in many societies. This trend is exemplified by *public campaigns and intellectual arguments*, such as Richard Dawkins' book "The God Delusion," which posits that religion is a ==human construct for comfort.== Dawkins advocates for a focus on science over belief systems like horoscopes.

However, this decline is contrasted by two opposing trends:

**Religious Fundamentalism:** In some parts of the world, ==there has been a resurgence of religious fundamentalism==, as observed in Afghanistan and during the Trump administration in the United States.

**Persistence of Tradition:** Even in technologically advanced societies like Hong Kong, **traditional practices such as fortune-telling 算命 and Feng Shui 風水 continue to thrive**. ==This raises sociological questions about why these long-standing traditions persist in a modern world.==
