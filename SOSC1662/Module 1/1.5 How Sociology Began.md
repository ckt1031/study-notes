## The Origins of Sociological Thinking

Modern systematic social thought, or sociology, is traced back to ***3*** major political and social revolutions that took place in ==Europe==.

While ancient Greek philosophers like Socrates (蘇格拉底) encouraged deep thinking about life, it was these revolutions that spurred the development of sociology as a distinct discipline.

1. The English Civil Wars (17th century)
2. The French Revolution (1789)
3. The Industrial Revolution (18th and 19th centuries)

## The English Civil Wars

Before the 17th century, life for most Europeans **had only ever experienced war, revolution, despotic and authoritarian leadership, illness, poverty and hunger**. The political philosopher Thomas Hobbes famously described this existence as "nasty, brutish and short".

This context led early social thinkers to focus on what they called the "problem of order": given that ==people are naturally selfish==, how is it **possible for them to live together peacefully**?

### Hobbes's Solution: The Social Contract

According to Hobbes, achieving social order required some people to **surrender their individual freedoms** to a ==sovereign authority==, like a king.

**In exchange for this sacrifice**, they would receive peace and security.

This arrangement, based on the necessity of cooperation, is known as a ==social contract==.

## The French Revolution and the Rise of Secularism

> 法國大革命始於 1789 年，持續至 1799 年，是==法國社會和政治發生劇烈動盪的時期，最終導致君主制的終結和新政治制度的興起== 。 在社會不平等、啟蒙思想和經濟困難的推動下，革命導致了巴士底獄的攻占、路易十六國王的處決以及恐怖統治的開始。 它為現代民主和民族主義奠定了基礎。

The French Revolution of 1789 was a pivotal event where the poor and peasants rose up against the aristocracy 貴族統治. This revolution marked a significant shift in the social order, leading to the aristocracy's decline and a victory for the common people.

The film *Les Misérables 《悲慘世界》* depicts the harsh conditions faced by the peasants under the French aristocracy.

### A Search for Non-Religious Solutions

A crucial aspect of the French Revolution was its departure from previous, **religion-based upheavals**. It was a deliberate search for non-religious solutions to ==societal problems, championing ideals like freedom, equality, and brotherhood==. This period saw a growing interest in **science and reason over religious faith**, with plans to build libraries and "temples of reason" instead of churches.

This shift led to the rise of the **secular state 世俗國家**. Functions that were **once the sole responsibility of the church**, such as recording births, deaths, and marriages, as well as providing education, ==were transferred to the state==.

It was in this environment that French philosopher **Auguste Comte** argued for the need for a "science of society." He coined the term "social physics," which later became known as **sociology**.

## The Industrial Revolution

The Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries, symbolized by factories and steam power, was the third major event to shape sociology. Key innovations in navigation and shipping enabled countries like Great Britain to ==expand trade globally==. This expansion was tied to the **exploitation of resources and slave labor** from other parts of the world to fuel manufacturing.

### Max Weber (1864-1920): The Work Ethic

Born in Germany, Weber's upbringing was marked by the conflicting values of his ==pleasure-seeking== father and his ==deeply religious== mother.  

**Core Idea:** Weber believed that technology ("hardware") was not enough for industrialization to succeed. A specific belief system or "software"—==an ideology that valued hard work==—was also necessary. He observed that the most diligent workers were often found in Protestant 新教徒 areas of Europe. These Protestants valued early rising, sobriety, and saving and investing money rather than spending it. According to Weber, ==this attitude of saving and accumulating== wealth created **the ideal conditions for capitalism to emerge**.

### Emile Durkheim (1858-1917): Individualism and Suicide

> Asian Value + Protestant => Rationalization => Capitalism

**Background:** Born into a religious Jewish family in France, Durkheim's father was a rabbi.

Durkheim made a paradoxical observation: ==the wealthier a country becomes, the higher its suicide rate.==

As societies grow wealthier, people gain more freedoms and choices. This leads them to see themselves as **isolated "individuals" who are disconnected from the larger society and solely responsible for their own lives**. With the declining influence of religion, people lack a ==guiding force== to help them make decisions.

> Religion becomes more board and general to include more people.

> ==Anomic Suicide==: individual experiences a sudden breakdown in the moral regulation of society, leading to a sense of normlessness, disorientation, and a lack of purpose.

### Karl Marx (1818-1883): Alienation and Social Class 異化與社會階級

**Background:** A German journalist and member of the ==Communist Party==, Marx was forced to settle in London, where he lived in poverty. He aimed to reform the capitalist system, not necessarily destroy it.

> **Class Struggle 階級鬥爭**, **Bourgeoisie vs. Proletariat 資產階級與無產階級**, **Exploitation 壓榨**, **Class Consciousness**

Marx observed that work in modern factories had become lonely, boring, and highly specialized. Workers experienced **alienation 異化**, a sense of disconnect from their work, because they could no longer see the finished product of their labor. They worked long hours for such low pay that they often could not even afford the goods they were producing. Marx noted that this feeling of alienation also exists in modern offices and even at universities. He argued that while capitalism creates immense wealth for some, **it leaves many others poor.**

### Georg Simmel (1858-1918): The Metropolis and Mental Life

> Social is a set of interactions  
> The dynamic relationships between individuals and how these interactions created and shaped society.

Born in Berlin, Simmel's father owned a chocolate factory, leaving him enough money to pursue his studies in philosophy.

He was interested in how individuals in large, modern cities could ==maintain their sense of self amidst pressure from society to conform==. He concluded that people achieve this by remaining anonymous and acting as strangers to one another. In crowded urban environments, it is common for people to avoid talking or making eye contact.

This sense of **urban anonymity** is intensified by electronic devices and was further amplified by the use of masks during the *COVID-19 pandemic*.

> Goal: To understand how individuals can maintain their sense of self in a society that often pressures them to conform.  
> **Solve social pressure**: By cultivating a sense of anonymity and acting as strangers to one another.
