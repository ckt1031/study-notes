## What is This Course?

1. To introduce sociological thinking, also referred to as sociological mindfulness.
2. To sociologically examine Hong Kong society.

We study liberal studies because we **all have problems that cannot be solved by science and technology alone**.

> For example, science and technology have not resolved the fact that we will all die one day, and before that we will all experience a fair amount of loss, disappointment, and rejection, and we will be deeply anxious about many things such as money, jobs, status, health, family, relationships.

It is addressing anxieties and guiding individuals on how others have lived to foster a better life and society. John Stuart Mill's philosophy that universities should aim to create "capable and cultivated human beings" rather than **just skillful professionals is highlighted**.

## Anxieties?

> The sociologists would argue our anxieties are not a result of a defective mind but rather the results of what's going on around us and the historical period in which we live
