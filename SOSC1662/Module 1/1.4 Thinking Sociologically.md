The sociological perspective encourages a ==reorientation of attention==, which can reveal a different reality.

This is likened to **optical illusions** where one's focus determines what is seen, for instance, two faces or a vase. A major human weakness is the difficulty in **seeing both images simultaneously**. Ultimately, one's reality depends on what one pays attention to and the questions one chooses to ask. This is summarized by the idea that "==we see the world not as it is, but as who we are==".

## Defining the Sociological Perspective

Thinking sociologically is presented not just as the accumulation of facts about society, but as a unique way of viewing the world, a form of "mindfulness".

While a standard definition of sociology is "the study of human societies," this is also claimed by other disciplines like psychology and economics.

Sociologists distinguish themselves by ==focusing on "the big picture"==, of ideologies, economic and political structures and social class **rather than the individual**.

## Two Metaphors

### The Crowded Beach

From the ground, a beach appears as a chaotic maze of people and objects. However, an aerial view reveals a more ordered situation with clear patterns, making life seem more predictable. **This "bigger picture"** is what sociologists aim to see.

For example, an aerial photo of Mumbai can clearly *show the socio-economic divide*, with poor residents in shanty towns and wealthy residents in green suburbs.

### The Pointillist Painting 點彩畫

Looking closely at a collection of random dots and colors reveals nothing coherent. By "zooming out" or moving back, a clear picture emerges. This demonstrates that the image itself doesn't change, but **one's relationship and perspective to it does**.

## Individualistic vs. Sociological Thinking

A central theme is the contrast between individualistic thinking and the sociological perspective.

Individualistic thinking attributes personal success and failure **solely to individual choices, attitudes, and merits**.

### Examples of Individualistic Thinking

Sociologists argue that this perspective is overly simplistic and ignores the broader social, economic, and political contexts that shape individual lives.

#### Talk Shows

Guests, often celebrities, discuss topics like fame, addiction, or marital problems from a personal viewpoint. They focus on their **individual struggles and determination**, *rarely mentioning* the ==larger economic, political, or social structures== that may have played a role.

#### Self-Help Books

Books like *The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People* and *The Twelve Rules for Life* suggest that adopting the **right personal habits or rules** can lead to success in all areas of life. Similarly, books like *Attitude is Everything* propose that the right mindset can overcome any problem, making opportunities limitless.

#### Financial Advice

Donald Trump's book *How to Get Rich* offers investment strategies and business advice. This individualistic narrative momentarily **distracts from external factors**, such as the fact that Trump started his empire with a significant loan from his father.

#### Romance and Marriage

Advice books like *How to Make a Man Fall in Love with You* or *The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work* focus on individual actions and therapeutic advice. However, sociologists argue that ==social class and the state of the economy== are far greater predictors of marriage and divorce rates than the actions of individuals within the relationship.

#### Health and Diet

Books such as *You Are What You Eat* suggest that health is a direct result of individual food choices. This perspective overlooks the sociological question of ==who decides what food is available== and why it can be difficult to find healthy options.

### A Sociological Look at Academic Grades

- **Individualistic View:** Grades, academic assessments, and awards are typically seen as a direct result of individual achievement and merit.
- **The Sociologist's Questions:** A sociologist would probe deeper, asking about ==external== factors that influence a student's performance. These questions include:
	- Do some students need to work to support themselves *financially*?
	- Can *their parents* afford to send them to the best schools?
	- Do some students face *long commutes*?
	- Do students or professors have significant *family responsibilities*?
	- Are *grading standards* different across various courses or majors?

## Grade Inflation as a Social Phenomenon

If grades were purely based on individual merit, it would be *hard to explain grade inflation*.

According to photo above, only 15% of students are getting A's in 1940, but in 2010, over 40% of students are getting A's.

The sociological perspective is: **Vietnam War years** (specifically 1972-1976) as a period of significant grade inflation. Because male students could avoid being drafted into the army by staying in college, professors may have been more generous with grades to prevent them from flunking out and being sent to war.

This means that their grades isn't purely based on individual merit, but rather influenced by **external factors** like broader social and political events.

> **COVID-19 pandemic** is another example of a social phenomenon that has led to grade inflation, as many universities have adopted more lenient grading policies to accommodate students facing unprecedented challenges.
