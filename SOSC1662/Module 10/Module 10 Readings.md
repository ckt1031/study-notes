## Question 1

What does "envisioned belonging" refer to?

---

The concept of "envisioned belonging" refers to the socialization of immigrant children based on their teachers' anticipation of who they will become in the future.

It is not primarily about the students' present identities, but rather about the **futures that teachers anticipate for them.**

This "envisioned belonging" is shaped by teachers' perceptions of who can become a member of Hong Kong society and how that can be achieved. **These beliefs, in turn, may influence how much the students actually come to belong in the future.**

## Question 2

What common cultural differences do teachers express about both *South Asian migrants* and migrants from the *Chinese mainland*?

---

**Inappropriate learning attitudes and behaviors**: Teachers complain that students from both groups are often:

1. "late for school,"
2. Do not do their homework
3. Fail to bring the correct books
4. Do not pay attention in class
5. Break school rules.

**Lower standards of public behavior**:

Teachers believe that BOTH have lower standards of public conduct than Hong Kong.

A specific example given for both groups is the ==failure to queue==, which is contrasted with the orderly culture of queuing in Hong Kong.

Teachers also attribute these issues to similar causes for both groups: **deficiencies 教養 in parenting and the failings of their previous schools.**

## Question 3

How do the teachers' understandings of the problems of these two groups of students differ?

---

Teachers' underlying understanding of these problems *differs significantly*:

**Mainland Chinese Students**

- In terms of **social or family issues**.
- Behavioral issues to a "social ethos" (社會風氣) learned from a Mainland society perceived to have social ills like *corruption and a weak rule of law*. These characteristics are seen as **acquired**.

**South Asian Students**

- Cultural difference
- Attribute rule-breaking *not to low morals*, but **to an "ethnic nature"** (民族性) that is perceived as **inherent** or innate.
- For example, they are described as being quick-tempered, impetuous 衝動, and easily provoked **"by nature."**

## Question 4

How do these understandings affect the teachers' views about what they can or should do to help the students, and what they teach the students?

---

**For Mainland Students**:

- Low moral standard that was acquired
- Teachers feel they have both the **responsibility and the capacity to correct it**.
- They actively work to instill **"correct moral ethics"** and "civilize" the students to fit Hong Kong's social norms.

**For South Asian Students**:

- Perceived as being rooted in an inherent "ethnic culture," teachers are **more hesitant to intervene**.
- Teachers fear "counteracting others' culture."
- *Cautious on sensitive topics* like religion and marriage
- Worrying that imposing "Western values" could *put students in a difficult dilemma* between their home culture and the school's teachings.
- Teachers are more likely to *see these cultural traits as difficult or impossible to change.*

## Question 5

What different assumptions do the teachers hold about whether, or not, each group can become Hong Kong citizens?

---

**Mainland Students**:

- **More likely to become accepted members** of Hong Kong society
- Problems are social and correctable
- Envision that education can successfully mold them into Hong Kong citizens.
- Mainland students can eventually become HK ppl.

**South Asian Students**:

- **Doubtful that they can become "full members"** of Hong Kong society.
- Cultural differences are seen as ==so fundamental and inherent== that teachers do not envision them being able to *fully fit in with Hong Kong's values and way of life.*
- Implicitly believe that South Asians CANNOT become HK ppl.
