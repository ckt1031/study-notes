## Historical Context and Migration

### Colonial History

South Asians first migrated to Hong Kong in 1841, concurrent with the British.

The British colonial government strategically moved workers with specific skills around the empire, and ==South Asians were often placed in respected positions== like police and civil service jobs.

### Post-1990s Wave & Shift in Status

A new wave of South Asian migrants arrived in the mid-1990s.

**After the 1997 handover, language policy in the civil service shifted to Chinese.**

This change disadvantaged new immigrants and even older generations, ==depriving them of the well-regarded jobs they once held.==

### Language as a Barrier to Employment

Proficiency in written and spoken **Chinese** became a ==requirement== for many licenses and jobs, even when not essential for the role itself (e.g., a football coach).

This has led to South Asians being **denied basic service jobs**, such as working for the MTR.

It wasn't until *2016* that Hong Kong saw its first and only non-Chinese Pakistani taxi driver.

## Education: The Central Challenge

**The Post-1997 Language Shift**: The change in the medium of instruction ==from English to Chinese== after 1997 created significant **hurdles for poorer South Asian students.**

### Limited and Problematic Schooling Options

**Expensive Schools**: Wealthier families could opt for private international schools or those subsidized by the English Schools Foundation (ESF).

**Designated Schools**: Poorer students were often channeled into "designated schools," which *receive extra government funding* to support ethnic minority students. ==There are 28 such schools.==

### Problems with Designated Schools

#### Segregation and Lowered Expectations

In these schools, *South Asian students* are often ==not expected to compete== with their Chinese peers

South Asian students are given **separate**, sometimes **simpler easier**, assignments and exams. This creates a form of isolation or "segregation entirely in one school."

#### Unclear Selection Criteria

The government's criterion for selecting a designated school is having a **"critical mass"** of minority students, but it *fails to define what this term means.*

This leads to funding disparities:

- One primary school with 450 minority students received no funding
- While another with only 76 minorities received $500,000.

#### Decline in Chinese Enrollment

Once a school becomes "designated," **the number of local Chinese students enrolling tends to drop.**

Chinese parents may see it as a =="punishment" to send their children== to such schools.

#### Vocationally-Limited Curriculum

The "Chinese as a second language" courses often focus on *basic language* ==for service and hospitality industries== (e.g., restaurants, hotels) **rather than for higher-skilled, better-paying professions.**

## Social and Cultural Barriers

### Discrimination and Bullying

South Asian children report **bullying, exclusion, and name-calling** from Chinese students.

One student recalled classmates saying her food was "poo."

A YMCA survey found that almost **15% of Chinese primary students admitted** to frequently using **racial slurs against South Asian children.**

### Religious and Cultural Insensitivity

Many local schools, which may be **Buddhist or Catholic**, do not accommodate the religious and cultural needs of South Asian students.

Issues include rules against **wearing headscarves** and a lack of **provision for special dietary requirements**. While a rule against headscarves could be seen as indirect racial discrimination, the ==Race Discrimination Ordinance does not cover religious bigotry.==

### Ethnic Minorities VS Expatriates 外籍人士

The terminology used reflects a social hierarchy.

- **People from Western countries** are often called "expatriates," a term with ==more prestige==
- **South Asians** are labeled "ethnic minorities."

## Government Legislation and Its Failures

### Race Discrimination Ordinance 種族歧視條例 (2009)

Make discrimination, harassment, and vilification 誹謗 based on **race** (defined by color, descent, or national/ethnic origin) unlawful.

### Lack of Enforcement

Despite the ordinance, the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) has **been criticized for its ineffectiveness.**

In the 12 years following the law's passage, ==the EOC failed to bring a single case of race discrimination to prosecution.==

**The case of Abdullah Kabir**:

A high-achieving Pakistani kindergartener who *was rejected from a primary school* after receiving a zero on a Chinese entrance test where *he claimed he was asked no questions in Chinese.*

*The EOC took on the case, but the outcome is not detailed beyond the investigation.*
