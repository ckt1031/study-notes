- The Labour Secretary, Matthew Cheung, stated that abuse cases are isolated incidents from a few **"black sheep"** 害群之馬 in the community. This contrasts sharply with NGO data.
- Police statistics can be misleading; in 2013, they recorded only **37 "wounding and serious assault" cases**, not capturing the more common minor assaults.

## Historical Context of Maid Servants

The **ill-treatment** of maids may stem back to the traditional Chinese practice of 妹仔 (maid servants who were effectively purchased).

Leading to a lingering 揮之不去 mentality that **domestic workers are property.**

## Government and Consulate Response

The Indonesian consulate acknowledges receiving hundreds of debt-bondage complaints but blames unlicensed **"sub-agencies"**.

印尼領事館承認收到了數百起債務奴役的申訴，但將責任歸咎於未經許可的 「次級機構」。

NGOs allege **"collusion"** between the Indonesian government and employment agencies, claiming the system puts workers in a disadvantaged position where they have no rights.

非政府組織聲稱印尼政府與就業機構之間存在「勾結」，並聲稱該體系使勞工處於弱勢地位，使他們毫無權利。

> As of 2014, Indonesia had announced a policy to **stop exporting domestic maids by 2017**, forcing Hong Kong to look for new sources like Myanmar and Bangladesh.
