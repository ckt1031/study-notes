## Migrant Domestic Workers (MDWs) in Hong Kong

Migrant Domestic Workers (MDWs) constitute a significant ethnic minority group in Hong Kong.

As of 2021, there were 375,884 foreign domestic workers in the city:

- Philippines (55%)
- Indonesia (42%)
- Smaller numbers from Thailand and other nations.  

Their presence in Hong Kong is driven by a **combination of supply-side factors in their home countries and demand-side factors within Hong Kong.**

## Supply-Side Factors: The Push from the Philippines

The reasons for the large-scale migration of domestic workers, particularly from the Philippines, are rooted in *historical and economic circumstances*.

### Historical Land Inequality

400 years of Spanish colonization **concentrated land ownership** in the hands of ==a few wealthy, absentee landlords.==

This inequality was worsened during the *American colonial period in the 1930s*, when land was **transferred to American corporations** (e.g., Del Monte) for growing cash crops like ==pineapples and bananas.==

### Modern Economic Pressures

By the 1970s, **a mere 15% of the population controlled over half of all agricultural land.**

Successive governments *failed to effectively redistribute land*, creating a large population of **landless peasants** unable to afford education for their children or healthcare for their families.

### Government Promotion of Labor Export

The Filipino government actively promotes its **citizens as "export commodities."**

In 1988, President Corazon Aquino famously called **overseas Filipino workers "national heroes."**

The government **relies heavily on remittances from these workers**, which accounted for as much as *13% of the Philippines' GDP*. A 2018 report noted that *over USD 1.1 billion in remittances was sent to the Philippines from MDWs.*

## Demand-Side Factors: The Pull to Hong Kong

The demand for MDWs in Hong Kong surged in the 1980s due to several **socio-economic shifts.**

### Women in the Workforce

An increasing number of **Hong Kong women** ==returned to work after having children.==

### Gendered Assumptions

- A prevailing assumption exists that *men will not contribute equally to housework and childcare.*
- Leads to a further gendered assumption that *women must be "imported" to fill this domestic labor gap.*

### Lack of Institutional Support

The Hong Kong government and workplaces **generally do not provide adequate licensed daycare centers**, unlike in many other developed economies, indicating a low prioritization of housework and childcare.

### Government Policy

In response to these factors, the Hong Kong government **relaxed immigration quotas in the 1980s and introduced standard contracts for domestic workers.**

## Problems and Abuses Faced by MDWs

MDWs face numerous systemic problems, discriminatory practices, and abuse.

### Immigration Status and Contract Issues

#### The "Two-Week Rule"

If a domestic worker is fired or a contract ends, she must leave Hong Kong within two weeks.

**This rule creates a significant power imbalance**, as the employer effectively controls the worker's ability to remain in the country.

#### No Path to Permanent Residency

**Unlike other foreign workers**, MDWs ==are not eligible for permanent residence==, even after decades of working in Hong Kong.

#### Live-In Requirement + Moonlighting

Contracts *mandate* that MDWs *live with their employers.*

NGOs argue this policy, introduced in **2003**, makes **workers more vulnerable to abuse and is akin to "slavery."**

> Led to reports of workers being given insufficient space, inadequate food, and even being forced to sleep in cupboards or bathrooms.

**Prohibition on Moonlighting**: Prohibits from taking up other work, including part-time domestic duties.

#### Working Hours

While a minimum wage is set, **contracts do not specify maximum working hours**, leading to many working 12-14 hour days or even being on call 24/7.

### Predatory Agencies and Debt Bondage

- Deceiving women in poor areas **with false promises of high salaries.**

#### Excessive Fees

*Agencies in both home countries and Hong Kong often charge exorbitant fees.*

While Hong Kong law caps agency fees at **10% of the first month's salary**.

An undercover survey *found 70% of agencies charge far more*, sometimes equivalent to six months' salary.

#### Debt Bondage

**Indonesian law** allows agencies to *charge training and placement fees* that can total $14,000 over seven months.

These agencies often **collude with moneylenders in Hong Kong to trap workers in loans to pay these fees.**

#### Illegal Practices

Agencies illegally **confiscate passports** to **ensure loans are repaid.**

Some Indonesian workers are also forced to **work for free as "training"** before even coming to Hong Kong.

#### Lack of Regulation

Difficult for Hong Kong authorities to regulate agencies operating outside their jurisdiction.

### Physical, Verbal, and Sexual Abuse

#### Prevalence of Abuse

Surveys and NGO reports indicate widespread abuse.

One survey of over 3,000 MDWs found that:

- 58% experienced **verbal abuse**
- 18% suffered **physical abuse** (like slapping and kicking)
- 6% reported **sexual abuse**.

#### Specific Cases

The documentary "Helpers' Hell" highlights severe cases, such as that of Erwiana Sulistyaningsih, who was *tortured by her employer for months.*

Other workers reported *being denied food, hit, and threatened by their employers' entire families, including children.*

### Economic Contribution and Societal Impact

#### Contribution to Hong Kong

Massive, ==often unacknowledged==, contribution to the economy.

Contributed USD $12.6 billion, accounting for **3.6% of the city's entire GDP**. Their labor enables more local women to join the workforce.

#### Impact on Home Countries

Remittances are a vital source of income, contributing to **poverty reduction** in countries like the Philippines and Indonesia.

**Social**: The mass migration of mothers has led to negative social consequences, including:

- **Neglect of their own children and elderly relatives**
- **High rates of divorce and broken families.**
