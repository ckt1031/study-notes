## Question: Hong Kong as a "Chinese City"

The common assumption that HK is exclusively a Chinese city ==is questioned==.

Many iconic Hong Kong institutions were established **by non-Chinese and non-British individuals.**

- **Indians**: Founded ==The Star Ferry== and the ==University of Hong Kong (HKU)==.
- **Iraqi Jews 伊拉克猶太人**: Founded ==HSBC== and ==CLP== Holdings.

> Hormusjee Naorojee Mody (HKU) -> Indian Parsi businessman 帕西族商人  
> Dorabjee Naorojee Mithaiwala (The Star Ferry) -> Indian Parsi businessman

This evidence points to a long history of multicultural contribution to the city's development.

## Georg Simmel and "The Stranger"

> Sociologist Georg Simmel's (1858-1918) theory of "the stranger."

A "stranger" is a unique social type who is a member of a group but **remains distant from "native" members.** They are simultaneously ==an insider and an outsider.==

**Function in Global Cities**: Simmel argued that global cities _need_ "strangers" to perform crucial functions.

1. **Trade**: Facilitating the exchange of goods, money, and information.
2. **Arbitration 仲裁**: Serving as objective third parties for conflict resolution (e.g., judges, lawyers). They were seen as ==more objective than local residents.==
3. **"Dirty Work"**: Taking on jobs considered unimportant, undesirable, or "dirty" by the local population. _Example_: domestic helpers

## Linguistic Evidence of a Multi-Ethnic Past

Street and place names to illustrate the deep-rooted presence of _various ethnic groups in Hong Kong._

**Sassoon Road & Mody Road**: Named after Iraqi and Indian families.

**Praya**: Portuguese for waterfront, as in Praya, Kennedy Town.

**Shroff**: Derived from Hindustani 印度斯坦語 and Arabic words for a money changer or bullion merchant 金銀交易商.

**Rednaxela Terrace**: A misspelling of "Alexander" due to a clerk confusing English ==left-to-right reading== with Chinese right-to-left reading conventions.

> 列拿士地臺

**Mong Kok**: The spelling should likely be "Wong Kok" possibly due to a sign maker's error.

## Defining "Ethnic Minority" in Hong Kong

> Based on the work of John Erni and Lisa Leung.

- **Visible Differentiation**: They share visible traits (e.g., skin color) that distinguish them from the majority population.
- **Awareness of Status**: They are _conscious_ of their _minority_ social status and their difference from the majority.
- **Experience of Disadvantage**: They experience ==inequality and disadvantage== within the society.
