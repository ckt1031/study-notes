| **Source of the Problem** | A flawed **"social ethos" (社會風氣)** from the Mainland.                                          | An inherent **"ethnic nature" (民族性)**.                                                       |
| **Perceived Nature**      | Acquired social and moral failings that are **correctable**.                                   | Innate cultural traits that are **difficult or impossible to change**.                       |
| **Teacher's Role**        | To **"civilize" and "instill correct moral ethics"**; they feel a responsibility to intervene. | To be **cautious and hesitant**; they doubt how much they can or should intervene.           |
| **Envisioned Belonging**  | They **can become** full members of Hong Kong society through education.                       | They likely **cannot become** full members because their culture is fundamentally different. |

## Strength of Hong Kong Identity

A poll revealed how strongly locals identify as "Hongkongers" over "Chinese".

The feeling of being a "citizen of the People's Republic of China" was the **weakest identity tested**, ranking lower than being an "Asian" or a "global citizen".

## Arbitrary Application of "Culture"

The reading highlights how teachers apply cultural explanations selectively.

For example, they accept that South Asian fathers have authority due to their patriarchal culture.

However, they **do not apply this same cultural lens to traditionally patriarchal Chinese families**, instead viewing family problems as ==purely social issues.==

> For Chinese, they blame on social rather than individuals, but for south asians, they blame on individuals that cannot change.
