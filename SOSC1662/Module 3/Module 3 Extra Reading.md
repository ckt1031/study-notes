> **Preferential Trade Access:** Hong Kong often received favorable trade terms and quotas from Western countries, especially the US and UK, which facilitated its exports.

- **Forcing a pivot from entrepôt trade to manufacturing.**
- **Providing a massive influx of capital, entrepreneurial talent, and labor.**
- **Elevating Hong Kong's strategic importance, leading to Western support and preferential treatment.**
- **Accelerating its development as a financial hub and a gateway for future engagement with China.**

During the Cold War, **US leaders strongly opposed communism.** They tried to stop its spread. They supported Taiwan and Korea. This strong dislike from capitalist countries explained why socialist China did not take back Hong Kong after its revolution. ==Hong Kong was China's only port.== Through Hong Kong, China earned foreign money. This money helped China buy needed foreign equipment. China supplied Hong Kong with food, water, and raw materials. ==This lowered Hong Kong's living costs. It also made Hong Kong more competitive globally.==
