## World Systems Theory: An Overview

Developed by sociologists *Immanuel Wallerstein and Andre Gunder Frank*

World Systems Theory posits that the economic development, or often, the **"development of underdevelopment"**, of a region ==is the result of its contact and relationship with the West==.

This perspective shifts the focus **from factors internal to a country to the dynamics of the global capitalist system**. The theory outlines three major phases of contact that have shaped this world system.

## 1. Merchant Capitalism 商業資本主義 (16th–19th Century)

This initial phase was characterized by forced trade and slavery. European powers, having developed superior military and maritime technology, initiated a system of ==exploitation==.

**Triangular Trade**: Europe, Africa, and the Americas.

Slaves were captured in *Africa* and transported to the **Caribbean and the United States** to produce raw materials like sugar, cotton, and tobacco.

The finished goods and the profits generated were used to acquire more slaves, the self-perpetuating cycle of exploitation.

> It was By the 1960s, that cycle kind of creates the modern world capitalist system

**Forced Trade**: In Asia, Britain used its military power to compel trade with nations like China, leading to events such as the Opium Wars 鴉片戰爭 (1838-1860), which resulted in the ceding of Hong Kong Island and the Kowloon Peninsula.

## 2. Colonialism and Dependency (19th Century–1960s)

**Core and Periphery**: The world became divided into "core" and "periphery" countries.

- **Core countries** focused on ==manufacturing and sold== finished goods to the periphery.
- **Periphery countries** supplied raw materials to the core. This ==prevented periphery nations from developing their own manufacturing sectors== and made their economies dependent on and vulnerable to Western markets.

**Cash Crops 經濟作物**: Traditional local industries ==were replaced by those that served the West==, particularly through the cultivation of "cash crops".

> Cocoa in South America, coffee in South America, tobacco in the Caribbean, tea in India and Sri Lanka, and sugar in Cuba and the Philippines.

**Dualism 二元論**: This economic structure often created immense inequality within peripheral nations, a condition known as "dualism". This is marked by the ==coexistence of modern industries serving the core alongside traditional ones for the local population==, and extreme wealth disparities, as seen in São Paulo, Brazil, where luxury apartments exist next to shantytowns.

其特徵是服務核心國家的現代化產業與服務當地居民的傳統產業並存，貧富差距極大，就像巴西聖保羅的情況一樣，那裡的豪華公寓與貧民窟並存。

### Consequences of Colonialism

**The introduction of Western diseases** like smallpox and measles devastated local populations.

Traditional leaders were replaced with new leaders **who served the business and political interests of the core nations**. The lecture notes cite U.S. support for figures like Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden during the 1980s as examples of this dynamic.

Colonizers created =="artificial states,"== particularly in the Middle East, by drawing borders **without regard for the rival ethnic and religious groups living there**. This has led to persistent conflict and instability in countries like Iraq.

> The problem with this is that unknown to the colonialists, many of these small countries contain rival ethnic groups that often fight with one another --> very hard to form a stable government

## 3. Post-Colonialism (1960s–Present)

This period recognizes that even **after colonized nations achieve political independence**, the ==fundamental problems of colonialism persist==. Many former colonies today continue to suffer from extreme inequality, political interference from the West, and internal conflicts that are a direct legacy of their colonial history.

> Numerous modern conflict zones that were former colonies, including Somalia, Angola, Myanmar, Lebanon, Sudan, the Congo, Iraq, and Afghanistan.
