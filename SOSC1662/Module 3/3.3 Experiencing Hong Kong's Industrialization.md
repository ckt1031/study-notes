## The Boom Years: 1940s-1970s

During the mid-20th century, Hong Kong transformed into a manufacturing powerhouse. Entrepreneurs, capital, and technical skills flowed into the city. Many came from Shanghai's textile sector in the late 1940s. This helped Hong Kong industrialize.

**High Demand and Plentiful Jobs:**  
Demand for manufactured goods was high. This led to many new factories. In 1978, there were 3,349 factories. Textile and garment factories were most important. They made up over half of all exports. Many jobs were available. Factory work often paid more than office jobs. Finding work was easy.

**Labor and Working Conditions:**

The demand for labor was so high that even with overtime, it was difficult to meet production needs. This environment allowed workers to change jobs with ease. However, ==labor protection was minimal.== Workers faced long hours, often until 10 p.m., with no paid holidays or maternity leave, and work-related injuries were common. A "piece work" system, where employees took work home, was also prevalent, allowing manufacturers to **bypass factory safety and child labor laws.**

**Economic Prosperity and Risk:**

Many workers invested in the stock market. They often borrowed money using their homes to do this. During this time, ==people felt hopeful==. They believed hard work would lead to a stable and prosperous life.

## The Turbulent 1970s and Economic Transition 經濟轉型

**Stock Market Crash and ==Oil Crisis==:** In 1973, the stock market crashed, causing many families to lose their homes. This was compounded by the global oil crisis, which increased the cost of plastics—a key material in manufacturing—and led to controls on electricity, halting night work in factories.

**Protectionism and Shift in Production:** The United States, a major market, began to implement protectionist policies, *limiting the number of imports from Hong Kong*. In response, Hong Kong's manufacturers shifted from producing low-cost goods to higher-quality, ==more expensive items.==

**Decline of Manufacturing and Rise of a Service Economy:** By the early 1980s, an economic recovery was underway, but the landscape had changed. ==Soaring land prices== made it more profitable for **factory owners to sell their industrial properties** to real estate developers. Many factory owners also ==moved their operations to mainland China to take advantage of cheaper land and labor==. This led to a ==decline in manufacturing jobs== and the emergence of a service-based economy.

## Social Consequences: Hawkers, Housing, and Government Relations

**The Rise of Street Hawkers:** Many former factory workers became ==illegal street hawkers==. They did this to earn money. The colonial government stopped giving out new hawker licenses in 1972. They thought this would reduce hawker numbers. Instead, about 200,000 people sold goods illegally. The documentary "Running from the Ghost" 《逃離幽靈》 shows the lives of these hawkers. For example, Cheng Hon Ming was an illegal hawker for seven years.

**Housing Crisis and Squatter Settlements:** Housing was a big problem. Thousands of people lived in squatter areas. This included new immigrants from mainland China. Government housing authorities watched these settlements closely. They wanted to stop them from growing. They only offered new housing after checking if a person was truly homeless. Often, people stayed in poor transit camps. They were observed there for weeks or even a month.

**Impersonal Government Relations:** The documentaries show a strained relationship. The colonial government and the public did not connect well. Citizens often felt the government was "cold and ruthless". Social justice advocates fought unfair policies. Urban Councillor Mrs. Elsie Elliott was one such advocate. She wrote letters to the housing department. She challenged their strict rules. This conflict appears often. It shows a gap between government policies and people's daily struggles. The administration focused on control.
