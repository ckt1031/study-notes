## Work Done by a Constant Force

When a constant force of magnitude $F$ (in Newtons) moves an object a distance $d$ (in meters) in the direction of the force, the work $W$ done is:

$$
W = Fd
$$

The unit of work is the Joule ($\mathrm{J}$), where $1 \ \mathrm{J} = 1 \ \mathrm{Nm}$.

## Work Done by a Variable Force

When the force is not constant but varies continuously with position, described by a function $F(x)$, the work done in moving an object from $x=a$ to $x=b$ is given by the definite integral:

$$
W = \int_{a}^{b} F(x) \, dx
$$

This integral represents the accumulation of **infinitesimal** amounts of work done over small intervals.

## Work vs. Energy

The *work-energy theorem* relates the work done on an object to its change in kinetic energy. If $x(t)$ is the position of an object of mass $m$ at time $t$, and $v(t) = x'(t)$ is its velocity, then the work done by a force $F(x(t))$ from time $t_0$ to $t_1$ is:

$$
W = \int_{a}^{b} F(x) \, dx = \frac{1}{2} m v^2(t_1) - \frac{1}{2} m v^2(t_0)
$$

where $a = x(t_0)$ and $b = x(t_1)$. The term $\frac{1}{2}mv^2$ represents the kinetic energy of the object.

**In simpler terms:** The work done on an object equals ==the change in its kinetic energy==.

**Example:** If a force of 10 N stretches a spring 0.1 m from its natural length, then $10 = k(0.1)$, so $k = 100 \text{ N/m}$.

## Hooke's Law and Springs

Hooke's Law states that the force required to stretch or compress a spring a distance $x$ from its natural length is:

$$
F(x) = kx
$$

where $k$ is the spring constant. The work done in stretching (or compressing) a spring from $x=a$ to $x=b$ is:

$$
W = \int_{a}^{b} kx \, dx = \frac{1}{2} k (b^2 - a^2)
$$

## Lifting a Chain

Consider a chain of length $L$ and mass $M$ hanging vertically. The linear density of the chain is $\rho = \frac{M}{L}$. The work required to lift the entire chain to a height where its bottom end is at the original top end's position is:

$$
W = \int_{0}^{L} \rho g x \, dx = \frac{1}{2} \rho g L^2 = \frac{1}{2} MgL
$$

where $x$ is the distance from the top of the chain.

$$W = \int (\rho \cdot V(y) \cdot g \cdot D(y)) \, dy$$
