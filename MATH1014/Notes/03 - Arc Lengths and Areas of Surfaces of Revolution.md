## Arc Length

### Formula for Arc Length (Function of x)

If $y = f(x)$ is a differentiable function on the interval $[a, b]$, the arc length $L$ of the graph of $f(x)$ is given by:

$$
L = \int_{a}^{b} \sqrt{1 + [f'(x)]^2} \, dx
$$

This formula calculates the length of the curve $y=f(x)$ between the points $(a, f(a))$ and $(b, f(b))$.

### Formula for Arc Length (Function of y)

If $x = g(y)$ is a differentiable function on the interval $[c, d]$, the arc length $L$ of the graph of $g(y)$ is given by:

$$
L = \int_{c}^{d} \sqrt{1 + [g'(y)]^2} \, dy
$$

This calculates the length of the curve $x=g(y)$ between the points $(g(c), \ c)$ and $(g(d), \ d)$.

## Surface Area of Revolution

### Formula for Surface Area (Rotation about the X-axis, Function of x)

If $y = f(x)$ is a differentiable function on the interval $[a, b]$, the area $A$ of the surface generated by rotating the graph of $f(x)$ about the $x$-axis is given by:

$$
A = \int_{a}^{b} 2\pi f(x) \sqrt{1 + [f'(x)]^2} \, dx
$$
