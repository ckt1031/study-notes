Find the constant $C$ for which the improper integral $\int_{0}^{\infty} \left(\frac{4x^{2}-1}{2x^{3}+3} - \frac{Cx+1}{x^{2}+1} \right) dx$ is convergent.

---

$$
f(x) = \frac{(4-2C)x^4 - 2x^3 + 3x^2 - 3Cx - 4}{2x^5 + 2x^3 + 3x^2 + 3}
$$

To make the $f(x)$ to converge, the term with the highest power in the numerator must vanish, $4-2C = 0$, so $C=2$
